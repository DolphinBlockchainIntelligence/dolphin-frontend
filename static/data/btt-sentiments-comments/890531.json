        "David, please, listen to me. As far as I know you are not a graphic designer either. Please let a professional handle this. Anyone who is not a graphic designer professionally simply cannot know or select what is a good logo. It's like if you were not a programmer and someone showed you some code and asked if you thought it was good. You have no idea, and it looks like it works, but it actually is full of holes and backdoors because you have no idea what you are looking at. It's the same thing for graphic design, except people think anyone can just look at something and know if it's \"good\" or not. The reality is that they can't, which is obvious with the people saying some of these logos are \"good\" when they look like they were designed by middle schoolers for a class assignment. If you want BitBay to look credible, you have to shell out the cash for professional design -- for the logo, for the UI, for the website, everything.  It's 2015 now, and people are accustomed to a certain style and usability in apps and websites. If you can't deliver that (and from what I've seen you can't without outside professional design help), nobody is going to take BitBay seriously. You raised a ton of money via the IPO, you can afford a few hundred dollars for some professional design work."

        "Hey there, I agree with what you are saying also. However keeping the community engaged is also nice. We will award winners regardless of if the logo gets used or not. With that said, if you know any professional designers im more than happy to meet with them. Youve gotta realize, I'm on a brutal deadline now. So I've got very limited time to manage every minor project. If im not coding, I'm eating networking or sleeping. We've got a dev fund and some BitBay also I'm ok with paying out of pocket a bit too. So management/secure a good project manager is the bigger challenge than actually just shelling out coins. Actually, I used to do professional design from editing to commercials and graphics. But of course time is a concern. A good project manager is needed. And just because there are funds, budgeting is critical. There is no right answer to correct budgeting. It takes someone with excellent foresight and business acumen to budget properly. So yeah, im looking for a supercoder, project manager and some people to step up to do these engaging community bounties. Just relax, let everyone enjoy the competition. We will pick winners regardless of if the logo gets used or not. We can always change the logo and if anyone knows a pro designer, I'm more than happy to look at his resume/work etc. Everyone knows my original intention was to be project manager. However now, I've got many different things to work on in the code and it will be months before i can relax. I can give as much time as possible to work on project management but it comes second to coding."

        "David, these are some excellent designs and show awesome enthusiasm, but amytheplanarshift is right, the marketing aspect is so important and you have to get it right. Additionally, you haven't set any parameters for the logo, e.g: -Palette - what colours (and also does it need to match the website, because at the moment it doesn't)? -What does it have to achieve/say/stand for? What is the message? -Goal - does it have to be instantly recognisable by a wide audience at a point-of-sale? Are you looking for buy-in from payment processors? In which case simplicity and bold colouring maybe win? -What does it have to look like as a mobile app? Where do you see the logo being used? These are all things that you have to think about. I do believe that the re-brand is the right approach however (considering recent events), but maybe think about a professional designer? I really don't want to rain on anyone's parade because the enthusiasm is\u00a0 really good to see (and I will be the first to admit I am rubbish at marketing) but you need to get this right. It needs to be professional and to set the right message."

        "Well, Steve was the one to start the competition. So the palette, I really like the original light blue and teal pallets. I think that we don't want to get confused. As for logos, I'm a big fan of symbols. Apple has the \"Apple\", facebook has the \"f\", etc. Many successful brands have two syllable names and some form of universal symbol. Even in religion, many religions are represented by a basic sigil(the cross representing self sacrifice, the star representing magic). So my use of the \"Halo\" in my personal brand was a way to \"make any coin honest/pious\". The Halo was an \"honor amongst thieves\" and was branded to assume that anyone can be trusted and become trustworthy as long as they are secured in a double deposit. It also represents the cross-platform nature I wanted my software to take. I just simply hated the fact that all crypto was so ruthlessly competitive and wanted them all to have access to a universal trust system and unite between differences. As for NightTrader I used the owl for judgement and wisdom and the idea that if you trade at night you would be a \"Night Owl\". It also was in parity with \"Daytrading\" which is common with penny stock holders but also gave the credence to Bitcoins dubious past. So thats how I think when it comes to branding. As for bitbay, I think the \"B\" just as in Bitcoin can be the symbol but represented in a unique way. Its funny, the original logo had a chinese feel to it which I actually liked. However, the markets may be international if successful. And its always good to have a logo to encompass your future vision. I think payment processors is not the target market. The target market is consumers who want to be connected and part of a stable growing economy. We should target everyone to stop by Bitbay. I like the idea of crossing oceans and uniting barriers. As if you would connect with someone anywhere in the world in their international bazaar harbor. If there is any target market in businesses then it needs to be people who want to be part of the \"E-Bay of Bitcoin\". So we should also target merchants who want to be in Bitcoin but didn't know how. The stability with pegging will really excite them. The double deposit aspect is the selling point that \"nobody can possibly scam you and profit\". So it also seeks the \"adventurous\", \"pirate-bay\" type merchants who want to explore new and revolutionary ways to sell their products. Being able to set up show with us is a million times more important than have a decentralized market anyways. The decentralization aspect must only be good for not having a server. And I think that gives it an Alibaba international feel too. So thats the brand i can conceive in my mind. I'm a bit of a Don Quixote so I know that will probably never be reflected in a brand. So we have to be modest right now and accept the nice gifts the community is bringing. They are having fun and thats is by far more important to me right now than running before we can walk. Mobile apps are complex. I'm in the process of negotiations with somebody to take on the Halo mobile platform. Bitbay mobile would need a server which would mean its not decentralized (which is fine for mobile and my idea for Halo markets was to have two methods of markets). I could easily code a custom parser for any blockchain with what i know now, but my time is extremely limited and even writing this post means im \"on break\" The site would need a redesign too. I certainly think thats a good place to spend as well. Again, I would need a project manager to assist in it. I would love to find designers willing to go under BitHalo contracts. I'm very picky now with employees since I just wasted time training devs in SE Asia(although I have yet to try India and may do so). The thing about websites is its hard to design with your vision in mind and then when you have to scale it because of advancements in the community the site would need constant updates and rebrands. That is exactly why I proposed so hard to BLK that I wanted a \"community portal\" in the main site. An interactive visual representation of a live community chat and a portal to all of their projects. Most sites are crap. Even my own personal Halo sites could use a major overhaul! So its a work in progress. This is a great place to start with the community. One thing to consider, if the community is designing logos, they feel like they are a part of something. I love Blackcoin for that. Its like the Doge community always volunteering ideas. I hope they know I'm still very much personally interested in their success and my loyalty always is with the communities I'm involved with. Bitbay was like a major exception by the way I was brought into it. But now that I'm starting to take the community under my wing a bit more, I'm happy to get all the milestones done. And consider Doge for a moment. They didn't have fancy \"artwork\" in fact a lot of the art was lazy cut and paste doge memes. But they were successful because it was a sigil and the community felt represented. Again, I'm always looking for people to hire. Perhaps the next bounty will be for \"finding me people and interviewing coders/web/manager\". And im willing to offer good money when that moment comes.  Although realize, the coin is still small because the market cap is only 200K and we will probably only be able to get 200-300 BTC in the dev fund since the other parties have left. Unless, we do see a price increase and then our Bitbay would be worth more. I'm willing to help the community and work with what we have. That is one of my specialties in my old businesses which was working in insanely tight budgets. I had a decent commercial package which was very successful that I used to run for a 200 dollar budget and usually made 50% markup and I used to be pretty good at datamining and automation. I've not gone into \"marketing mode\" too much because I prefer to have a product to market before doing that. So I'm in \"developement mode\" for Halo, NT and now BitBay. So basically, I'm pretty reserved when it comes to budgeting unless I can find someone who excels at it to assist me. I really want to save as much as possible if any developers are needed once my projects are complete. Of course that doesnt mean there isn't funds set aside for marketing. Obviously there is. However marketing is by far the most expensive part of being in business so it has to be approached with great care. As stated before BitBay was a clone of BlackHalo, so the great thing is, any work done in one can easily be put into the other and they will always have the unique differences of NT belonging to BlackHalo and pegging belonging to BitBay. And i think that works well because pegging makes the coin stable and is a very complimentary feature to markets. (people want to buy an item knowing that the price will not fluctuate much) Hope that helps."

One thing that does start to bother me though is that the 2 B's together are a very assymetrical combination. That's why it doesn't really fit inside the circle. Not sure how to solve it. Maybe cut some unnecessary lines at the left side of the logo? Making it more minimalistic and even. Or perhaps inverse the whole thing. Let the small B fall outside the large one rather than inward.  I really should get into illustrator because this is frustrating ^^ EDIT: Here's what I was talking about: EDIT: Or maybe make the circle slightly bigger"

This coin has been a great badluck charm for me, I have had nothing but trouble since touching bitbay. Not the coins fault at all, just seems like I picked up a penny that wasn't heads up. Couldn't log into exchanges for 2 weeks, computer has run like crap, monitor shit the bed, and that is just the computer side of it. Nevermind the non stop onslaught of shit that has been flying my way with life. Hopefully that all just means for once a coin will actually pay off for me. Has anyone had any trouble starting the wallet? I uninstalled and reinstalled, tried running in different compatibility modes, as administrator. I am on windows 7 and just downloaded the wallet from thebitbay.org. Anyone have any suggestions? Figured it out. Sorry to interrupt the turd the slinging contest you may now continue."

No one sits back and gets paid.. All the top earners in the world are up at 6 am, sleep at 1 am and do it all again the next day. You guys really just hate because I make the kinds of money you guys dream about at night.. Pay off the house money.. Pay of the school loan money.. New BMW money. And I make it regularly. Anyway.... good luck with your future plays but sitting back and waiting for magic wont produce a desirable successful outcome. I can assure you of that."

Lets see, according to the logs, you said there would be 500 in the dev fund when there was aparrently 100 You claimed you would be putting in 500 BTC to refund to your team but kept it for yourself. You extorted from BTER. You posted chat logs upon duress which is actually character defamation, cyberbullying and invasion of privacy. You made threats to all of your team members. And most importantly, you DIDNT EVEN DO YOUR JOB. You said you would pump the coin for months but clearly was dumping on your own team from day one!! Which also makes you a liar. DUHHHHHH!!!! DERPA DERPA... you dumbass. Can you really not spell or is that also an act? In fact, instead of marketing the coin, you FUDDED your own coin!!! I dont think thats even worth 1 BTC maybe negative five hundred lol. Lol the only reason you guys got money into that ICO was by using Daves reputation. The chat with Gekko clearly shows Daves concerns that he was told you guys were in for the long run. Which was obviously not true. And then, you guys run 100s of fake profiles with Ryan and your pump and dump team who even left you and were fudding your own coin from day one. lol... yeah the only reason you arent hanging by your balls is because you have never gotten harmed yet. And when it happens, lol wow. Have you ever considered being kind to others? Im not sure you can take your Bently with you to hell."

The microtrader is called \"NightTrader\" and essentially is my gift to Blakcoin(since it will have exclusive BC pairs). However, i can see people trading bitbay once it pegs in the microtrader to hedge out of bitcoin. Also, staking is possible, but only in BlackHalo. The new daemon however, has this bizarre RPC bug where python-bitcoinrpc causes timeouts and crashes only in blackcoind built for windows. I'm still trying to diagnose it. rat4 sent me like 7 builds to fix it and gave up to no avail.\u00a0 Need to identify if its because of a change in blackcoin or that simply the old rpc library is incompatible with the new build. The method of Staking in BlackHalo is called \"cold staking\" or \"multisignature staking\" where you basically use two computers or locations to stake making your wallet unhackable. You will see what im talking about in this version of Halo because you can basically do the same thing with regular purchases. (You can send coins from one location and have it automatically signed at another using 2 step spend). In this version I automated that task."

And the community is what its all about. 2nd unusualfacts30 All of your submissions were highly creative! And that counts for a lot. It is the people who are creative that always end up inventing new things because they are willing to take risks. And although your first submission would be more suited for a cool looking symbol than a logo, it was a really great looking design! 3rd EddyShark I'm a sucker for simplicity. All of your logos were professional. And although had we gone in this direction, we may have wanted to mess with the colors and style a bit, I liked the direction it was going. Also, as a bonus, I'm going to personally tip 50,000 BAY to everyone that submitted that didn't finish in the top 3. Please let me know if I left you out. The people below please PM me an address for sending the tips. funsponge spookycoins Decentradical KC6TTR digicidal"

        "BitHalo announces the release of version 2.1 of its decentralized escrow client, adding a new feature that aims to compete directly with companies such as Paypal and Western Union, said the organization in an announcement. Entitled the \"Advanced Payment,\" the new feature allows simple and secure peer-to-peer payments via email using either Bitcoin or Blackcoin. The \"Advanced Payment\" feature is sent from a peer that wishes to contract or send a payment to another. After both parties agree on a password they will use for the pay-to-email transaction, the recipient receives an offer to the email address he/she had provided, followed by helpful instructions to fulfill the procedure and a download link to BitHalo. Upon opening the personal client attributed to the provided email address, the user will have an option to enter the said password and then receive the bitcoin payment. BitHalo's founder and lead developer David Zimberk is surfing on the tipping movement, which he believes holds great potential in accelerating widespread adoption of cryptocurrency. \"There\u0092s a ton of utility in the [Advanced Payment] feature,\" Zimberk stated. \"I tested it on my sister, my friend in North Dakota and a friend in NYC. None had bitcoins before this, now they\u0092re compelled to join the movement and with the ease of a few clicks of a button.\" Launched in July 2014, BitHalo is said to be the world's first decentralized smart contracting software. It first supported solely Blackcoin, until August 2014, when the team added a multi-coin capability to support Bitcoin as well. BitHalo aims to eliminate middlemen, allowing users \"to create binding agreements peer to peer without the hassle or risk of involving a third party,\" explained Zimberg. He continued: \"It solves enforcement for most, if not all, types of contracts via both parties sharing in equal risk. [BitHalo] removes profitability from theft or fraud and allows anyone anywhere to trust a stranger.\" Halo clients include BitHalo and BlackHalo. Both had integrated NightTrader, a decentralized exchange and trading floor where users can conduct contracts and do business with new and existing parties."

Someone who buys at 0.01 would wait till hits 0.02 and then there will be buyers who wants it at 0.02 because they want to cash out at 0.03. Market will be more stable this way.

        "Hey lots of comments, thanks everyone for the support and encouragement. As for the pegging what some of the other community members said was correct. The new model we are looking at is more democratic allowing voting on deflation and inflation rates from the fork. The fork itself will cause X% to become reserve. Perhaps anywhere above 90%. From there you set either inflation from reserve to liquid or deflation from liquid to reserve. So that will allow a much more dynamic market where price and supply can match consumer demand. It seems that an investor would want to see the price grow and the way to do that is with deflation. Then if the price gets too high we vote for inflation. This also means its much less centralized. NuBits totally is centralized relying on only one exchange primarily and custodial wallets. We can let the wild forces of nature give the price a lot more play for traders and at the same time we can deflate the supply so price can match demand. This makes for some really interesting arbitrage. Additionally, it protects the coin from having a central head or liability. Voting is a good way to put the power in the hands of the users. I might want to take a majority vote from the voting address itself in the beginning to avoid market manipulation(making a consistent deflation). And eliminate that majority after we hit that first target. So even 1 cent is a very good target for the next 4-5 months. If we hit that level, and can continue to deflate we can grow gradually a few percent at a time. But anyways, we arent there yet. The topic of the next month will be linux/mac/windows 8 and markets. One of the troubleshooting i did today was with windows 8 and apparently i might need a specific build or make a few changes to our build. Also, for some windows 7 users, libeay32.dll isnt sufficient and they would need to install openssl. I'm going to consider how to make that more user friendly."

There was very few people who reported issues. And a majority of our visitors use Mac. Windows 8 is not as popular as 7 yet. Regardless, making it cross platform is not the kind of thing to have happen over night. It will be the next thing i work on though. Issie what issue are you having? Can you send me an email with a time we can talk on skype or do teamviewer? Anyone who has issues on windows 7 can solve them if they install openssl or simply contact me directly. Also, none of the issues are directly with Bitbay but with bitbayd or bitmhalo which is the headless daemon or bitmhalo which is bitmessage which requires openssl. In the directory you will see libeay32.dll and there are two of them for different windows builds. If those dont work, then install openssl. Later i can see if i can include it in the installer."

        "First you have to ask \"what is price\" ? Price is the equilibrium point between supply and demand as illustrated in this graph: \"Pegging\" is fixing the price using artificial market control methods to move either the supply curve or the demand curve to the left or right, thereby moving P* to a higher or lower valuation. BitBay proposes to deploy a mechanism which moves the supply curve to the left by restricting access to markets of coin holders who wish to sell. (Incorporated from NuBits). To see how well the peg works, go to marketcap and check the dollar price of NuBits... . It actually works pretty well. Once you've checked that, check the volume. Although I'm promoting it here, it actually sticks in my throat that this mechanism works. The reason I don't like it is because it only controls the supply side which is the easy bit. It's a bit like living in a desert and controlling the supply of sand. It would be better to be able to generate demand rather than restrict supply (which is what Bitshares does), but hey, I can't deny that I've been confounded. Nubits seems to have both volume and stable price which amazes me. I can't understand how they achieve that, but it may be that there now is emerging demand for cryptocurrencies that are stable against a fiat currency. My original criticism of the Nubits approach (restricting supply) was that price was substituted for volume. But again, I was confounded - look at the volumes here..."

        "That will depend on what you have in liquid assets. Look at it this way, lets say at the current prices, you have $1000 worth of bitbay (like 10 million coins). And lets say that after the fork, we do 90/10 split. So, you will only have 1,000,000 coins liquid and 9,000,000 in reserves. IF we vote for inflation at 1%, then you will be able to spend 1% of the 9 million. If the vote is for 1% deflation then you will be able to spend 99% of the 1 million and the 1% deflation will be forced back as change to the same wallet sending and will be tagged as reserve. You have only 1/10th of the coins liquid that at the original price would be worth only 100 dollars (assuming the price doesnt move). BUT the supply being reduced can cause the price to increase. Thus, lets say for example your 10 million coins will be worth $10,000 because of the reduced supply. Therefore you have exacly the same amount liquid as you had previously total. Since 1/10th of 10,000 is 1,000. So, if you did sell the $1,000 worth of coins after the fork, you would have to wait for inflation to access the 90% reserves."

        "I have long thought about this exact thing. However regardless of how they are doing it, the technique proposed at BitBay was to do a soft peg, more of a democratic hedge. Although at first, we wanted to do a hard peg inspired off NuBits but when I proposed the rolling peg people preferred the idea in the hopes it would provoke volume and be more interesting for growth. There is no guarantee we will get any buy walls although I dont see why we shouldnt get a reasonable one. MY theory is that a buy wall isnt needed if you have control over deflation. So BitBays peg would be a pure control over deflation rates. Since we wouldnt be paying interest for parking (although its an interesting idea...) then there isnt the need for custodians. However, parking is always possible with locktimes. The use of custodians goes against what I believe in which is trustless networks. Since our rates are controlled by a vote, its pretty close to trustless although i could see a person buying their preferred interest rate although it would be expensive to do. In effect, pure control over deflation and inflation rates would not be like NuBits which does have some elements of a ponzi (although he is misusing the term). Ponzi schemes are classically known as \"Rob Peter to pay Paul\" and thus, it means that someone would sell shares to a company at an inflated price to pay off old shareholders and if everyone was to call their shares forward they would be forced to shut down. The term \"Ponzi\" is misused so much, it reflects on how loose people are with words these days. So I think the author should be looking for another term. What he is saying is NuBits is not sustainable. Which may or may not be true. I dont like the centralized aspect which is why I'm not interested in a hard peg but a soft rolling hedge. This way, we try to promote growth in the coin by controlling supply to reflect demand. And this is only the first evolution of a deflationary coin. There will be many ways to expand off of what we are trying to do here. Perhaps NuBits can sustain itself since the walls always seem to be sufficient to hold the price. As long as the buy wall is good enough, i dont see how it can fail. Although the \"custodians\" arent obligated at all and thats why i dont want to use them. On the other hand, there is a great arbitrage opportunity in NuBits and even now with Bitcoin being very bearish, NuBits held its price. I suppose the true test will be in a bull market."

Luckily i didn't buy from the ICO but what i am encouraged by is David and his work, also that he is continuing to develop the project. I see great potential at BitBay because of the features it has and working towards. I see more positives now and for people who did invest at higher prices and who are continuing to hold they should remain confident because BitBay will only get better during 2015. I will try to become an active member of the community from now on. Keep the good work."

        "Hello guys, I have been giving most my updates on Slack because thats where most of the core team has been spending their time. One member(metakid) wrote an amazing bot for chatting and other things. Also he helped with marketing organization and promos and connected us to the new Qt wallet which is looking very nice. We will be setting up some permanent nodes so that staking will always have connections. As for me, I'm working now daily on markets. Today, I made the moderation and trust building system. So you can receive a rating, flag orders, leave reviews, etc. Everything in the decentralized server works like Bitcoin. I hash the orders and verify them with your public key which represents your account. There are two moderation keys as well for advanced moderation. Although it is decentralized and there is no central server. However, the peers keep a memory of what is going on and what they see and validate is what they will remember. So far its really cool its like the \"email of Bitcoin\" since each message is verified and I could add so many layers to it. I've even seen some interesting ideas on i2p with Bitmessage. I'm tempted to change more of it but for now we need the support of all the nodes. Blackcoin has prepared to add checklocktimeverify and we have also added it and will prepare to fork a little bit later with pegging. The markets already work. I can add nodes to make Bitmessage faster but I'm not going to do that for beta testing. Instead, we just have a local data directory which was a common Bitmessage request that I've taken the initiative to fulfill. I'm still debating with myself to add more nodes or not. The whitelisting system will be much more effective once we have nodes with great reputations. So I'm starting with the most basic. I've tested posting orders to the markets and I can easily add and remove orders or markets. Now I am designing the whole UI and templates. That is the most complex part since each template will auto-execute or greatly assist you. I've got to decide how much customization I want with it before debuting the markets. Its possible I will give some updates with screenshots in the near future."

One is more focused on trading, the other on economy. Personally the hedging in BitBay is very exciting to me and I think its the main reason to buy this coin especially now when its so cheap. Since it will be consensus driven deflation and inflation so the price will be able to grow with the demand. Once we add pegging, i think every coin will want it. In theory, it is a very powerful set of rules."

        "Hey gnarl thanks for this, all of your concerns are genuine and it gives us a chance to explain what has been going on with Bay of late. As you all know this project has not had smoothest of launches, and when the new team got involved the project was quite literally in shambles. There was no control of Bay's own media channels, partial control of some of the sites, a bunch of clients released some of which there was no way of knowing were even trustworthy, and a host of other problems not the least of which is the removal of about 1000btc from the project by it's initial collaborators. Since then we have set up new official twitter (@bitbaytalk), new  , and have a server ready on bitbay.market which is where the new official site will be hosted. On the software front David is working on the markets currently, but we felt the need to release new QT wallets while work on the advanced client continues, in beta. This allows people just wanting to stake or send/receive a stable, easy client, right now. And we do literally mean right now. We're leaking today's release here first. It is the new Windows QT BitBay client, which we've tested to work fine all the way from XP to 8.1. You can get it on  This is a short link that points to a file hosted on bitbay.market, which is, until further notice where all our releases will come from. So, Windows users, please DO NOT USE anything that isn't an official release posted by us either on here or through official channels, starting with today's release. The other piece of news relating to this is that we have setup a base node network of 3 VPS machines, which will be always-on entry points to the network and able to serve the blockchain in a fast and effective fashion to new users even in the early days. They are: US (New York) Node - 104.236.208.150 Euro (Amsterdam) Node - 188.166.39.223 Asia (Singapore) Node - 128.199.118.67 These nodes are now hardcoded into the new client so connecting should not be a problem. Do let us know if you have any trouble of course! About GitHub, we'll be putting the whole thing up shortly, users will absolutely be able to report problems and bugs, signatures will be in the releases, and as for your last question, answered above  Next up is Mac and Linux QTs, and after that Android will come as well. Now time to update the OP, soon after that will come the new site on bitbay.market. A community is coming together on the BitBay Slack, which is really a great tool and we encourage anyone wanting to get involved to join us. Let us know if you have any questions, we're here!"

Its too bad, this looks really cool and promising, but there are just too many GIANT RED FLAGS. You just \"released\" another build as a reaction to one reported issue.  You built and released it in less than 7 hours since I posted, there is no way it was tested thoroughly.  You put it behind bitly, so no one knows where it is coming from, and Bitbay.market is an abandoned blog... There is no hash or proof it is even bitbay code, and no one is standing by it and saying they built it. This build is a different size , again. (first 48mb, then 45mb, now 25mb... what was removed?) Chrome wont download it. Virustotal results have changed, now warnings come from clam-av heuristics.  The details show it was built on a different system than the last 2, who built this one? Come on... This is not how you release quality software. Especially software that holds money. Its releases like this that kill coins. I have seen it happen multiple times here. It ticks me off... I would like to see this go mainstream, it has a great foundation, but sketchy stuff like this can kill it.  you guys need help testing and releasing a product professionally, I can be bribed with beer and bitcoins.  Seriously. Fresh install testing, multiple os's, new user experience, beta testing, secure release procedures... My problem reporting and recommendations are much more pleasant if I am properly beered and bribed.  Either way, I will wait until its available on github and released with someones reputation backing it.  Twitter that when it happens! Good luck."

        "Hey gnarl, good to see you are fully paying attention, that is exactly the kind of involvement we are hoping for. As explained in the previous post, getting the good ship Bay sailing again has not been simple and we still have a way to go before we get there. So, a few things need explaining as there is a good measure of assumption in your posts. We did not \"release\" a new build, we released one. And rest assured, us posting it was not at all a reaction to your post. This is something that has been worked on for weeks, and if you check our twitter you will see a hint at this from well before your post. There is no way in hell we were going to be able to design a new UI, get it loaded up into a QT, compile and test all the way from windows XP to 8.1 (which we have done), as well as set up 3 static vps nodes, get command line clients working on them and have QTs use them, all in 7h. So, your assumption that all of this was caused by your post is we're afraid, incorrect. We have the original dev that worked on the early BitBay wallets doing this, as well as other members of the community. It is all being posted to Github and we'll be linking to that shortly. The newly released wallet is the only one we will support as it is the only one we can say we control fully. We put the link behind bit.ly for convenience and tracking, mainly as a way to keep on top of how many downloads we have. It simply links to  . bitbay.market is not an abandoned blog, it is a website that has not been started yet. We've had our hands full and I myself decided to prioritise QTs as I felt it is important to have stable, working clients for everyone before we do any proper promo. Now, you seem interested in helping us with release cycles, and to that we can only say, bring it on. I suggest you join us on slack and get to know the new team. You will find it is composed of people who bought into Bay early, and still believe in the concept and want to see it happen, just like you. We also have a bot that gives out unlimited virtual beer. You can PM us on here and we'll get you on."

I still stand by what I have tried to politely point out here.  The 2 different sized builds available previously still appear sketchy. Trying to distance yourself from them now (in bold above) appears really sketchy. Releasing a build through an obfuscated link, to a website that is not even started, without source code or hash, appears really sketchy. Twittering to the world to get this build, before the website is done or even a tech support faq is available, appears really sketchy. Secluding any tech support or bug reporting in an invite-only support forum, that is not searchable or usable by normal users, appears really sketchy.  If you cannot take the time to finish the website, provide a support faq, stand behind each build and release it safely, and work with the users openly, Why should anyone trust the software with their money? I guess everyone will just have to wait and see if your promises about github are true. If that occurs, I guarantee more people will support this project. Myself included. Until then, it just appears too darn sketchy..."

        "^ True. Not only that, but they clearly stated that the \"markets\" they are building are not even for BitBay only. Markets are developed for \"Halo\" which BlackCoin also gets and probably added to the Halo bitcoin wallet too. So where is the real development for BitBay? After following what's been going on for awhile, I think it's finally time to leave this charade. Only \"pegging\" is exclusive to bitbay, yet it hasn't been a priority since the project began 3 months ago. When the pieces don't fit and other things take priority for other coins + rushed wallets and no clear answers, it's time to step away. I may invest in BlackCoin since it's getting the markets and they have a much bigger community and support base. I wanted to like this project and put a large investment into something unique and exclusive. Damn it!"

We cannot fully support previous wallets because, we did not build them and do not control them. We were not part of BitBay when they were made. We decided to release because it is important for people to have access to updated wallets. We did so without a website because waiting for the website would mean delaying wallets, not something anybody gains from at the moment. Support FAQs will be up soon, and again, we are here, on BCT, on Twitter, on FB to answer to anybody that has a problem. So we are not in a situation of 'no support' at all, we are simply working on better channels for it. We are not secluding anything to our Slack, you were invited to it because it is where the active Bay community hangs out, so it is the most direct (and pleasant) way to get in touch. You are completely in your right to decline this invitation, nobody ever said it was the only way through which you'd get support (just currently the best one). Once again I would like to make the point that none of these procedures have been done in a rushed or careless fashion. The fact that you have not heard from Bay on BCT is not to be construed as us not being very busy putting this project back on track. Now about promises of github - here you go:  This is the source to the new QT client. Clone away, look about, and by all means if you want to get involved in dev let us know. There is nothing 'sketchy' about the team now running this project. Yes there was at the start, as everybody knows, this was a complete mess that ended in one of the biggest FUDstorms ever. It is only natural that all of you on here need to be reassured, and we will keep doing that until we achieve your trust."

I'm working on a highly complex markets system and our other members were working on the urgency of getting nodes hard coded so you can always stake! The reason this was priority is because if people don't stake for too long, there is a time stamp issue with the block and we would suffer a fork! That problem had to be addressed first. The next thing they will work on is the website. As for the point about markets not being exclusive to BitBay I agree. But here is something to consider. Blackcoins markets was branded for NightTrader the microtrading exchange platform in their markets. BitBay is a better brand for markets \"aka the ebay of bitcoin\". So from a marketing perspective, the two coins are very different from each other. I love BC and would never recommend against it. However pegging is good for markets specifically because it can reduce volatility while people make purchases. Consider that Bitcoin ALSO gets access to the markets. How can we have a market in BlackHalo/BitHalo/BitBay if people can't use the most popular currency of Bitcoin? Coins have different brands and different roles in the industry. There will always be unique differences between the coins I'm developing for."

        "It was oversold a bit, but it's there. I probably should elaborate on this one. We all read things differently. I for one got the understanding at the IPO that the merchants from alibaba were more or less lining up to sell on bay market. That is not the case. However, Steven, the guy who took the initiative to start this coin, does have connections with merchants on alibaba. I'd be surprised if we get as many on board as we would have if this had played out differently. Merchants are like you and me. They like to be on the winning team. That's why we don't focus on on the \"alibaba-connection\" at the moment. Bay's reputation took a big hit, so we need to get this back on track first. Personally I think we are on our way to succeed with this, but of course there's still work to be done. As to the merchants, we do know we have a few that will be there when markets open. It will not be dealextreme volume, but there will be a range of products. If you have ever done a startup with a project that requires buyers and sellers to meet at your specific page, you know how hard it is to attract one without the other. On Bay market products will be listed from day one. That's a lot better start than many market projects get although it might not be as grandiose as I for one thought it would be."

This will be incredibly useful for people who are new to crypto and don't want to constantly babysit the price of alts. The moderation system is done. The reputation system of course will be worked on during templates and such(rewarding good behavior). The way the reputation system works is \"you judge what you see happen\" so if you are not logged in to BitBay, you wont save to disk what people are doing. This may encourage people to stake because they want the most up to date market data too. A way to keep the data redundant is to encourage moderators to run servers. A decentralized reputation system is really helpful for node performance too. Of course its going to have to take on a life of its own."

As I'm confused... ...are we not here as a whole trying to break free from fiat centralization construct? Trust me, I'm 'all for' a stable priced cryptocurrency, but as I've briefly glanced over Nubits tech, it seems that they 'dictate' when someone can sell their coins?  Correct me where I'm wrong as I might just not see the big picture? I've got a few ideas of my own as to how this could work, but I'd like to hear dev's prospective on the matter first. I know this \"pegging\" concept is still in dev state and somewhat secretive, but as you devs have made clear - it's coming to Bitbay. \u00a0I respect the privacy on the matter, but yet, can you guaranty that it still fits the \"decentralized\" molding that make crypto what was, is, and hopefully should always be? A way for people to store and transact credits and debits without a centralized bank/government 'dictating' how it's going to be done and at the owner's expense? Thanks in advance!"

        "Hey there, this is a wonderful question and I would like to say that perhaps the word pegging is a misnomer. Because the technique I'm actually implementing is deflation to create a stable hedge. All coins inflate. We are adding the possibility to inflate or deflate. If it deflates your coins forcefully become reserve but they become more scarce and thus more valuable. Then later we can inflate and stabilize the price. So if fiat disappears this will still be one of the most powerful features in crypto. It means we can focus less on price and more on features. So how is deflation determined? By voting. So there is no central body who decides the inflation and deflation rates. However since there is a possibility that people will vote in their own favor, in the early days there will be a majority vote to deflate at least 90% and re-stabilize the currency. So basically after the fork you will have coins as liquid and coins as reserve. The mining rules will not allow you to sell reserves unless there is inflation in the majority vote. By the way, i think everything should be decentralized... I'm a purist. I dont even like Bitcoin because mining is centralized. So yeah the voting is the only caveat here and all wallets get an equal vote. And those systems will improve over time. NuBits uses custodial wallets which was way too risky and volatile to me. We are trying to change the world here and it can't happen when you fall back on old habits like trusting third parties. So I think NuBits is very lucky to have gotten this far. However it was the inspiration for my idea that I explained above."

        "As you said the pegging is still under development, so that limits how clear an answer we can give you. Pegging is naturally about controlling supply and demand. The easy version of it would be buy and sell walls. If we were to peg bay to its current value that would be easy with buy and sell walls. 100 bitcoin would be a pretty unbreakable buy wall at today's price. Pegging bay to $1 however would require an insane amount of bitcoin. We can use walls at those levels, but only to flatten minor movements in price. Instead of locking enormous amounts of bitcoin in a wall, we are looking at the supply instead. By freezing a percentage of the bay in everyone's wallet we reduce supply to a level where it meets demand at the price we want. This can be done in different ways, and the main difference between strategies is whether it is a voluntary freeze or a forced one. A voluntary freeze would of course only affect those that voluntarily freeze their holdings, and might be a good mechanism to handle small to medium changes in demand to the downside. The big changes to the downside and also increased demand for bay would have to be dealt with by changing the percentages of frozen bay in everyone's wallet. I assume this is what your question is about. How will that be dealt with? Who makes the decision when to freeze and release bay? This can also be handled in different ways. Main models being automated versus controlled by humans. An automated model would work very much like a trading bot, only it would freeze and release bay in everyone's wallet instead of placing orders. It would also inherit the weaknesses of a trading bot, and can be manipulated. That means we might need a team to monitor and tweak it. So the most decentralized solution would in fact be the most centralized. With humans there are two basic models. A council versus everyone voting. We are leaning towards everyone voting, because we also believe in decentralized systems. At first glance you would think a pegging system is a straight forward thing. You just have to decide whether to use buy and sell wall or control of supply. However the devil is in the details. Should we use a hard or a soft peg for instance? I.e. do we peg it to $1 exactly or $1 +/- 20%? Do we peg it to $1 directly or do we use a rolling peg starting at say $0.01? Do we handle small fluctuations in demand the same way we handle big ones? How do we encourage the flow of bay between exchanges, merchants and consumers? There are pros and cons with everything. The choices we make on every question influences the whole system, and thus also what mechanism or mix of tools we need to use to achieve our goal.  So to answer your question: We want it to be decentralized too, and we think voting is the way to go. But voting may not be practical for every fluctuation, so it is likely that it will be used for the major decisions, and that we use other methods for handling small fluctuations. NB. If you have ideas I'd like to hear them. Please send me a pm"

        "This is one of the most important questions. Basically, they need to keep track of inflation and when an input has arrived. I'm going to have an application for the exchanges to calculate the inputs properly. They will probably want to add a coin class called \"BitBay Reserve\" and when inflation happens. BitBay and BitBay Reserve get updated. And when trading, the exchange will need to only know when the trade took place to calculate interest accurately. If the exchange does not do this, they will oversell the coin and then will not be able to honor withdraws (the withdraws would get declined). BTER is our primary contact for this. They already have NuBits and BitUSD so they are one of the most friendly exchanges with pegging assets. We need to have trust in the exchange. However, we can certainly buy and sell coins inside the BitBay or NightTrader markets."

If you are not trying to sell your POS coins, then it should be in your wallet staking - where a middleman can't screw things up for ya. I'm no expert, but maybe with the new wallet, it caused the coin age to reset back to 0 days/hours maturity? Though after each maturity, the coins split and continue to split into smaller fractions. In theory this supposedly just allows you to accumulate smaller amounts of stake rewards but at a faster rate, so in theory, it's the same amount of interest\u00a0 as if you had a maximum amount of coins maturing at the hourly set limit, yet over time you'll just get fractions every few seconds (depends on block time). Supposedly helps secure the network that way.  My question for anyone to answer is... what is the set amount of fractions the coin splits into and who dictates that amount??? So let's say you have 2 million coins, and after a year of constant staking, those coins split into 1 coin stake rewards and continue to split even more... How exactly does the entire wallet stake all the mature coins on hold if these splits can only allow so much to stake per block time reward and continue to split? Shouldn't there be a set limit to how many maturity splits are allowed? LIke I\u00a0 said in my example if I have on average 1 coin stake per 1 minute block time (or whatever it is) that's only 60 coins staking per hour x 24 hours x 365 days = 525,600 coins out of the original 2,000,000 staking.

We are in a growing industry so expect this environment to hinge on what I've just said here. Only the very lucky few honest people make it because their products were powerful enough and didn't get sabotaged. Crypto is not a healthy industry because it revolves around money and thus is currently driven by greed not ideology. This doesnt mean it wont progress though. It will but it will probably end up in the wrong hands. Hopefully, new people can come into the space and develop but then again with the open source issue they would need some serious motivation. Devs are not fund raisers and fund raisers are not devs. Dont let this demotivate you, in contrast, it should help you notice the projects that are worth their salt."

        "Hey man, don't beat yourself up over it. So far it's still looking like the thief was only after BTC, but none the less, as the old-timer saying goes, \"nothing like bought experience\" - meaning, you lose money to learn to never to do that mistake again! That being said, we have a coin here that can correct the system. Crypto was created in part so that the middle man would be 'out of the picture'.  I've even heard a Cryptsy chat moderator say once, \"if a hack hit them, the only thing they could do is 'pull the plug' and hope for the best.\" I think exchanges will continue to strive, as people are lazy, but for the sake of bringing in the 'high roller' investors, a system needs to be created that is unhackable.  Sure, crypto coin math is flawless, but the people would think they can manage it for you are nothing but potential flaws. Just look at Blackcoin's exco.in! Dumbest human flaw on the \u00a0planet, and it was all perpetuated by the 'worry' that if they didn't have the fastest exchange system on the planet, then it wouldn't fly! Guess what - it didn't even take off and probably won't ever now because it's humanly flawed!  With Bitbay smart contract tech, a secure system program can be achieved without the middleman screwing things up (and for a fee to top that)."

        "You are welcome. Thanks for the support. The good thing is this is the first time in history open source projects really stand a chance to get noticed. Imagine combining blockchain tech with video games or having stocks that run like crypto assets and pay dividends honestly. The only thing left to do is decentralize everything including farming(spirulina/water from air), manufacturing(3d printed electronics), home building(Compressed earth block machines and 3d printed homes), communication/media(local meshnets), energy(spirulina again, solar and a million other techs), petrol(spirulina again) etc etc Bitcoin is very destructive to idealists because it draws the wrong kind of attention. The idea of decentralization is not being pushed and instead centralized services and middle men seek to dominate it and already have done so successfully(centralized mining and 3rd party services get 100% of the VC funding). Thats why a lot of people don't like Halo. It gets rid of middle men in a quest to reduce that fat in society. \u00a0It also makes deception impossible or very impractical which is not going to be very popular with 50% of society. This same fat that makes people wealthy BUT in the long run makes the majority poor since the resources get abused and people are extracted from. A bottled waters price is determined by the middle men services to get it to you. You in turn pay for everything BUT the water (you pay for the marketing, the lawyers, the branding, the shipping, etc). Excess consumption was never a good idea and its going to take a miracle to have middle men want to disempower themselves. Imagine how many jobs are completely pointless because they are servicing the middle men. A majority of the jobs we do serve no true function other than sustaining the broken system and support pointless industries only geared at extraction. Even though governments would never admit this or realize it because they are afraid and live in perpetual fear, they actually benefit from cutting down consumption. But they think they have to constantly increase it to obfuscate themselves and control people. If the unnecessary services were eliminated, people could actually live their lives and express their creative potentials and we would advance immensely. Everyone would win. But i think society is heading in the opposite direction and its maybe so difficult to resist the tide. The problem has and will always be media(not money the problem was never the money, it doesnt even exist). The truth is out there but the only thing that can't be decentralized easily is the voice/media. Anyone that tries will get destroyed. The other \u00a0issue is changing the hearts of men. It may never really happen since most people only think in terms of their immediate desires. Speaking of which, bitcointalk is not a good website anymore because it has become overrun with fake profiles. I think the next bitcointalk should require a bitcoin balance and a valid public key to register. Really, this site should be shut down."

There was a weeks delay getting settled again. So far I'm still the only coder although I do have someone on a Halo contract re-factoring the code for efficiency and such. So things are moving along just wanted to give an update. As for the issue with BTER it honestly may be good that we saw that. Im never using an exchange again I lost at least 3 btc on there and like 2 on mintpal. So perhaps when Bitbay pegs we would want to use only decentralized exchanges so we can be sure they wont sell inflated coins. This is a topic we should cover when that day comes(when I finish the deflation). I know we can always trade decentralized in the markets themselves."

Of all the massive scandals related to cryptocurrencies, they've always been \"centralized exchange\" related - where you trust someone else to hold your coins. I'm sure you know this so don't hate me for responding, yet I'm guessing the BTER hack was great wake up call for you, as any of your alt coins could have easily been stolen as well by the \"middleman flaw.\"  IMHO, what I like about Bitbay is that it already has the potential (with smart contract tech) to put centralized exchanges out of business for smart investors. Once the marketplace is set up, I will be able to name any coin I want to either buy or sell and if someone else wants to buy or sell to my offer, I can initiate a smart contract system to create the transaction void of any exchange screwing things up or hacking - plus removing the factor of price spread volatility. Top that all off with staking your coins to gain new coins for free and new wallets are new nodes which help strengthen the network! Cheers"

The only drawback is it wont be high frequency and you would have to wait for confirmations. But it will be automated so you dont have to think about it and only leave the client running on your computer. It will support many different coins we may charge an entry fee to set up a coins daemon etc. One way to increase the speed of this is to set up a few high speed servers for the markets. But first we should see what people think about the markets when released. Right now im working on the templates."

Brand value alone being one of the most used altcoin clients. The more well known the software, the more value the advertising is. If I charge a fee perhaps it will be optional considering its a decentralized exchange. Most people probably would not disable the optional fee I've had some really funny ideas for advertising one being a \"decentralized billboard\" where you can buy adspace and resell it and the highest bidder is shown in the client. Again, there would be no middle man so any ad space bought would be free and clear.

        "Pegging is still in the workshop, so we might still do things differently than I say now.  That said, we are discussing a rolling peg. With rolling peg we mean it's not set once and for all. A plausible scenario is that we start by pegging it to $ 0.01. As demand increases, we will release the frozen bay. When all or most of the frozen bay are released we change the peg to say $ 0.1 and freeze a certain amount of bay again.  If we use the rolling peg it is irrelevant that the dollar looses value. We can peg to $10 or $1000 if we need to. We can also peg to a mix of currensies. As to less coins being frozen if we choose cny, you are right only if you set the alternatives to be 1 USD versus 1 CNY or 0.01 USD versus 0.01 CNY. The dollar is worth 6 times more than the yuan. But it is not really relevant how much of your coin are frozen. Your buying power with your spendable bay will be the same. The difference is that your frozeen bay are worth more (when released) if we peg to $1 instead of $0.1 Here's an example based on todays value of bay: If we peg to $0.01 and freeze according to marketcap, we would have to freeze approx. 98% That means there would only be 20 mil bay in circulation If you buy bay for 1 btc ($275)\u00a0 at 50 sat you get 2 mil. bay When pegging starts 98% will be frozen. You can spend or sell 2% of your bay. 2% of 2 mil is 40 000 spendable bay 40 000 bay x $0.01 will be worth 400 dollars. 20 mil (the totall amount of spendable bay) at $0.01 is only $200k  With buyers and seller having to hold some bay for smart contracts we would have to release more very soon For now we are going with the US $ because it is the worlds reserve currensy"

        "If I understand you correct, you are arguing that the choice of currency influences how often we have to freeze and release bay. That is not correct other than possibly as a minor influence on a very long term (and no one knows the future). The problems you are addressing are very relevant on the other hand; how often shall we vote for freezing or releasing bay. For instance we will have to release a lot of bay for christmas shopping (some retailers have up to 70% of their yearly sale for christmas), and then we will have to much bay available after christmas. This is one of the hard ones, and thus one of the reason we still have pegging in the workshop. Obviously it's not practical to vote to often. Voting should be for the major decisions. So we are looking at different combinations of automation and incentives to voluntary freeze, so we don't have to do a voted freeze/release for every fluctuation in the market. The goal is to have a little more bay released than we think is needed at any (most) time. This \"surplus\" bay we want to be able to control into voluntary freeze/release through incentives to handle fluctuations in the need for bay. It is of course possible to handle this with a buy wall that is big enough, but we want to keep that as small as possible because money locked in a buy wall has a \"lost opportunity\" cost. As to your link that shows net trade and earnings, that does not say anything about how much a currency is used. Nr. 3,5, and 6 on that list are oil nations. I'll pick nr. 6, Norway, because I know something about it. Norway has it's own currency, Norwegian kroner (Nkr). But the wast majority of Norways trade is done in US$ and euro. Much of Norways savings are also held in US$ and euro. Nkr is only used domestically. In fact, in alot of countries you would have a hard time buing local currencies for Nkr. The US$ on the other hand is used in the whole world. In several countries it's actually more wanted than the local currency. @HouseOP: The choice of US$ is not a political statement. In fact I'm not sure if it would be possible to find political topics where the bay team would agree among our self."

        "It should be mentioned that any exchange we work with has to correctly calculate the reserves or else they will end up overselling the coin on the exchange! Then if too many people try and withdraw, the transactions will get declined (the exchange wallet can't spend its reserve). So, any exchange we work with, will have to run a custom program to calculate the balance correctly. This means keeping track of who you sold to and what the interest rates were at the time. I can write an application to make this easy for them, however they must use that application responsibly and not oversell the coin. That requires trust because if they oversell it, people withdraw too much then the transactions get declined. Any exchange running this program will give you two balances, BitBay and BitBay reserve. They will have to give you coins if there is inflation too. However, if you trade Bitbay on a decentralized exchange (such as in NightTrader or BitBay markets), then you can do it perfectly with no need to trust an exchange. However, considering exchanges like to work with pegging coins such as NuBits, i dont think it will be a problem to convince them to take it. The trust factor is the thing. After seeing so many centralized exchanges go down, its hard to say if they would do it correctly. On the other hand, why would they not calculate the balance correctly because if they don't, people would be able to dump on the market and we would notice the problem immediately. Also, i personally like the idea of a rolling peg as opposed to a hard peg to allow stable growth. Thank you munti for the excellent explanation and analysis!"

Let the price move around as long as we can deflate to catch it. If you wanted to peg at a low price, you would be able to allow more coins in circulation. The higher price (to create walls) would require us to deflate tremendously. Imagine if we only had 50 btc walls to support $1. To be sure of that price we would be deflating maybe even 99%. So instead of focusing on that specific price, i think its best to make it a growth target (Chinese Yuan, Euro, BTC, whatever). Just deflate as you need to bring volume back into coin.

By the way, nice try on harming Davids rep. You failed miserably and it obviously bothers you that your lies didnt work. So you think the solution is to keep lying. Scumbag. Don't you realize Bob that lying is disgusting. This is why nobody likes you. You have to pay for friends in Crypto lol. Or in the case of your friend Gekko who sucks you off. You both sold your souls for money. Good going Bob, you are the most disliked person in crypto. Theif. Whats even funnier is David ignoring you... hahaha.

We want to do some tests with volunteers to make sure it runs smooth on all systems - Marketplace for BitBay and Halo: This is already working. - Templates and counter-offer system, new ui for escrows, etc: This is what is being worked on now We should test for at least a week privately in the community before official release. Then I'm going to have to make a decision once that is complete. NightTrader or Pegging will be after this. The developement time for either of these paths are as follows... NT gives us an exchange platform to trade Bay especially off market sale of BitBay reserve using time locks. NightTrader microtrading template: 2-4 weeks Pegging: 4-6 weeks Cold Staking: 2 weeks"

Using BitBay you can now employ, hire, barter, trade, whatever. There is no servers, no escrow, no arbiters who dispute unfairly and no point of failure. Totally decentralized however there is several moderator keys and a basic reputation system. The only templates available are custom templates so make sure to make deposits even to the amount for most deals unless its barter then make them equal and trade half the value under it. For example, if microtrading make the deposits 1000 and trade 500 at a time etc. There is technically unlimited kinds of contracts and templates will make it easier to understand all the uses for it."

        "BitBay is open for public use, just let me know what platform you are on and i can PM a link. We are in the process of making sure Linux and Mac run smooth and getting a new landing page for the website and then can put a download on there. I'm looking into Syscoin Blockmarket. This is very interesting project. Can you explain to me how its decentralized? I checked their website and its not easy to navigate. I wish there was more explanation on their project. They don't seem to have any contracts system. Anyways, if so, hats off to them. I know that Open Bazaar was in private tests but no public release. In many ways, only BitBay and Blackcoin knew this release was coming so soon. Regardless, BitHalo was the first smart contracts and we've been around for almost a year now (May 29th release). So I can say that these markets that run in BitBay are not only decentralized, but extremely user friendly and have built in unbreakable smart contracts which can be used for sale of goods, employment, barter etc. What excites me is double deposit escrow since arbiters/middle men arent needed. (its 2 party escrow/ true smart contracts) Anyways, I would be happy to know more about what syscoin had developed. I always thought it was so awesome how they went after that Green guy from Mintpal. If you are friends tell them I said hello and wish them good luck on their project."

Personally, if someone else takes double deposit escrow and makes it used worldwide because they got inspired then i would consider that a huge success. As for Nxt markets, i know you have to jump through a few hoops to get everything set up. Also, they dont have multisignature nor do they have unbreakable double deposit contracts. So they would still need a good platform that doesnt rely on arbitration. Hopefully soon, i wont be so overworked and can look at what everyone else is working on."

        "Yes this is true and lack of support for multisig can definitely interfere. One impressive thing about nxt is that its codebase differs greatly from BTC. Different isnt always better though. I would be much more quick to support coins that make crypto easier like Node or highly creative endeavors like Huntercoin. Hell, even Gridcoin never got the attention it deserved. People buy Bitcoin because they worship the dollar and thus BTC has the highest dollar value and the most security. They dont buy Bitcoin because its the \"best\" coin. If anything, it technologically is one of the worst. Its slow and hasnt included any of the most useful patches since they are afraid to fork. And just like MySpace was replaced by facebook, Bitcoin will be replaced if it refuses to improve its technology. Their \"slow\" paced improvements on protocol that rely on feedback from part time devs will get slammed once a real serious attack happens like botnet sybil attacks or quantum computers. Furthermore if a serious company like Facebook or Microsoft came out with a coin (or a country makes its own coin like Venezuela) then perhaps Bitcoin will fall way behind. On the other hand, ive been talking to some friends and we think Bitcoin may go on another bull run. Also one of the arguments I had against nxt was it was a \"middle coin\" and it has been proven that decentralized exchange doesnt need a middlecoin. Examples are atomic trading (once enough coins get checklocktimeverify) or simply Halo microtrading such as in NightTrader. However, the crypto space is overly competitive as it is and personally i think devs need to collaborate more instead of insulting each others projects. So in reality even though i have my own opinions on coins, i wish them all the best. It gets tiring to hear devs \"looking\" for reasons to say something negative about other peoples projects. Instead they should be saying \"good job!\" Normally, I will openly support projects that have dedicated development. So to all the coins who work hard to develop \"good job\" and I hope they also see what we do here in Halo and that they clone some of our techniques to make their products stronger. This space will only succeed if we all work together. Because an outside investor can see the toxic environment of bitcointalk and run for the hills (they wouldnt really know the difference of the coins being new to the space)."

I would like to be corrected if im wrong on that, i was not able to find so much resources explaining how they decentralize The way Halo does is definitely 100% decentralized. First of all, your public key is used as your identity so you cant lie to the market. Everyone records what they see as an internal reputation system. The decentralized markets are built on modified Bitmessage channels. This allows for serverless markets. Also, bloat isnt an issue since there is no blockchain in Bitmessage. Instead nodes share messages that they store for 48 hours. Private markets can be created. Its completely anonymous however there is two moderation keys giving us the ability to keep the markets clean. A sort of \"decentralized moderation\" OB goes to a lot of conferences. I used to do that with Halo but realized i would rather be building things than marketing. The product will market itself by being awesome."

        "Oh, i almost forgot the most important point about Open Bazaar vs BitBay/Halo. Open Bazaar uses arbiters and that simply does not work. Because an arbiter would have a key to the transaction, they could easily collude with themselves to take bitcoins. Even more dangerous is the arbiters are simply bitcoin addresses and totally anon. If they choose to be the arbiters themselves then OB only serves as centralized escrow and therefore is definitely not decentralized markets. Also, arbiters cant prove who is lying during a dispute and are no more useful than closing your eyes and randomly picking a winner. Or, you would need a very biased policy like ebay. However, OB is more dangerous because unlike ebay, they can actually collude with themselves and take their own escrows. OB did express some interest in the Halo escrows once we open source however they are also defensive of their model. Im not exactly sure why though, after all centralization/3rd parties is exactly what we are trying to avoid so why use arbiters? I would be more than happy to show them how to do these escrows because i believe in smart contracts and double deposit escrow. Perhaps when we are all not so busy. Bitbay and BitHalo/BlackHalo don't use any of this. Instead of course, they use unbreakable smart contracts. Two party escrow. And because its a smart contract we can completely automate the entire buying process. Additionally, its not limited to sale of goods but can also perform barter and decentralized exchange as well as cash wires which OB definitely cant do. So the fact that there is a smart contracting system integrated into it makes it truly decentralized."

        "I said that? haha. Well I was planning on giving Dogecoin a Halo. However, the decentralized exchange NightTrader will support at least Doge and Dark. I have thought about giving an anon coin a Halo so i considered byte, dark, monero and shadow. But in not certain who has the best anon. I thought the best anon was monero(?), correct me if im wrong. Giving out Halo software there was a bit of a waiting list. A lot of coins would ask for it but that was months ago and my license fee was pretty high. The license fee can and will be lowered after the release of NightTraders decentralized exchange(but not necessarily for full halo software). Nonetheless, the fee to get on that exchange will be different from the ones who get Halos. So to clarify, Doge was the first in line to be considered for a full marketplace and Halo. DRK and Doge is being considered for NightTrader pairings. I've discussed privately the possibility for DRK as a Halo however their distribution was a concern and there is debate over who has the best anon functions, but its still on my mind. Actually, Halo is much more anon because the trades on Halo/NightTrader arent linked (entirely different blockchains). Other than that no other coins were considered. Most likely, any coins that want a spot on the decentralized exchange should contact me to get on the waiting list. there may be a fee because it requires a lot of work to change their source code and build it to make it so Halo can run it because Halo uses a special branch of Bitcoin called \"watchonly\". That fee will be set in stone later after the NightTrader exchange is complete."

In theory DRK isnt trustless because you can still track the blockchain mixer by watching the outputs. I think it would be fairly easy to write a script to reverse it. Hell, if they really wanted anon, they should try zero knowledge proof. Thats like the holy grail. I know Shadow tried it but i dont think they succeeded but i could be wrong. Monero shouldnt fud DRK, they are using totally different approaches to anon. Anyways, hopefully i can extend more Halo software. The thing is, I like to give out software and give the coin that I extend it to something unique. Something that is their own. For example, Blackcoin has NightTrader exchange. BitBay has pegging. Dogecoin would have a custom \"WOW\" client and I've got a few cool ideas for something unique to give them.

        "You point about Doge/BTC in a contract secure by BLK is 100% accurate. Doge is slowed down because it had to wait for the slow Bitcoin confirmations. Sadly, there is no way around this. However, i think we can use give the users an option to use a 3rd party service that checks Bitcoin mempools to have faster Bitcoin confirmations (this can be if both parties have agreed to it). That only works on Bitcoin because Bitcoin is very centralized. Regardless, if you trade Node/Doge then the Node confirmations would be instant and they would have to wait for Doge. However, NightTrader does everything for you automatically! It loads all 3 wallets, it watches for all the transactions and it automatically fulfills the contract. So as long as you leave your client running, your trade should normally take no more than an hour(depending on how many transactions). IF for example you chose to trade 1 BTC for 1 BTC of Doge under a BlackHalo NT contract, we have to know how many transactions it needed to fund. Lets say it funds .1 btc at a time. So the BC contract would create a .2btc deposit contract and trade .1 10 times. So it would take about an hour. However, if you traded BitBay for BC under the same contract it would take 10 minutes. So faster currencies would fund really quick in NT. And besides it is worth it, decentralized exchange with no trading fees and no middle coin! You may be right about DRK coin mixer. Even Tor had security issues though so we know that security will always need improvement. As for Zero Knowledge proof, your point about \"impossible to set up the network\" is true for non-interactive proofs such as Zk-Snarks. For interactive proofs, then that trust issue isnt required. To make it \"non-interactive\" trust is required for the person who set up the network, they would know the secret and could take advantage of that knowledge. Additionally, interactive proofs would eat up a lot of bandwidth and processing time. Zk-Snark is much lighter in weight. Actually, the bigger challenge with zero is simply figuring out a protocol!! Think of how many questions need to be asked to generate a proof. Aka \"Is it a wallet on the network?\", \"Yes\", \"Are there coins in it?\". \"Yes\"... and so on for each programming step you want to hide. Its intense. However, I do think it CAN be done and done efficiently. Unfortunately, i dont have the time to work on zero. The best ANON is still in Halo/NT because when I send you DRK(especially with the mixer) and you send me BTC there is absolutely no way to prove that was done because its two totally unrelated networks. There is no link from A to B and because no exchange was used its not possible to know the users who performed that trade. At best, you would need to collect data from the Markets to somehow try and solve who was trading at that specific time (but actually, the same attack can be used on interactive zero)."

I hate to say it but anyone who uses escrows on the darknet after sheep market losing 100 million, this recent darknet hack, silk losing 100 or so million. Not to mention centralized exchanges getting hacked people lost up to .75 billion (.5 billion by mt gox alone) by now in exchange hacks not to mention increase in distrust which alone has impacted BTC. Why people arent flocking to double deposit escrow and pegging tech just shocks me. When is everyone going to learn? Escrow should not exist! Bit/BlackHalo and BitBay doesnt use escrow, parties dont risk losing funds at all, it cant be hacked, it can enable barter. *sigh* ... perhaps its because I dont have enough time to do marketing so vaporware always wins. Also, people are always speculating on crypto and they dont even use the tech they do have. Even NXT and Ripple are better than a centralized exchange still people dont learn their lessons. The major issue is not only the cesspool bct has become which is a reflection of greed, emnity and envy. But also, the fact that people still worship the dollar and treat it as god. Its like this: Bitcoin is closest to the dollar so people stay in Bitcoin because its almost the dollar. What does Bitcoin do except waste billions of dollars of electricity, is slow, is highly centralized (15 pools control almost 100% of transactions) and they dont even update their ancient scripting system?? They should have hard coded a centralized way to fork so at least their devs can update the codebase. But no, thier devs spend time wondering about protocol changes(they dont even have locktimes after 4 years) while altcoins can freely test any protocol they want. The \"too big to fail\" attitude of the Bitcoin foundation may actually turn against them. After all these hacks, probably more than 50% of btc belongs to theives, the exact same people it was meant to protect us from."

Basically, you withhold one critical transaction to a temporary account for leverage in negotiating a time bomb. Then both parties have a copy of that and to prevent malleability both parties can either negotiate a refund or refuse to proceed until the bomb is signed. Then once its signed they fund a joint account. The joint account has only 2 keys. So no actual escrow is needed. Both parties made a deposit simultaneously and even possibly advanced an amount. Any instant refunds would be based on the same txid as a time bomb so again malleability cant be performed. I think the same logic can be used for AT. Hope that helps. The short answer to your question is: \"It is stored in a joint account, there is no escrow, just double deposit\" Instead we could say \"2 party escrow\" as stated in my paper."

I dont want high level technical details , I want basical framework how it works, If you dont mind. 1-) Bob wants to buy a cellphone and Sally wants to sell her cellphone. 2-) They agree to buy-sell at a certain price and make a contract. 3-) Then , Bob sends his money to double deposit account , and also Sally sends some amount same account (double what Bob sends?) with some timelimit 4-) Then, Sally sends her cellphone to Bob, Bob gets his product 5-) Once he confirms his product as good , then he release initial amount and all deposit goes to Sally's account Here are my questions: a) First of all is above scenario correct? b) How can we be assure Bob is not manipulating the system , saying that I didnt take my product ? c) Lets say there is a problem with Bobs country's customs and product waits very long time. What will happen? Or in our country cellphone from outside is not allowed. Our custom does not also \u00a0send back to sender. They just get the phone. And sell it at an auction.

        "Hi EMIF thanks for the support. First of all you had it correct except its in reverse. If Bob and Sally are total strangers with no trust, then Bob would deposit 1 and advance the amount 1(for the phone). Sally would only deposit 1 to avoid extorting from Bob. So at first Bob is -2 Sally -1. Then Sally sends the phone worth 1 So Sally is -2 Bob is -1 If Bob says he didnt get it he is still -1 and just paid double for the phone. If customs really provably had a problem, then Bob should contact Sally and explain. Its up to Bob and Sally to agree before the time runs out or they both lose. Of course insurance is recommended with international packages! However, if customs took the item, then both Bob and Sally then would want to agree on an extension. If Bob ever tries to steal the phone he is -1 and will pay for his deception. If Sally really has no trust for Bob she can even make him pay more deposit before entering a contract. Trust levels is dependent on how new the parties are to the system and what Sally thinks. There is also a rating system so deposits can be lowered after good behavior. The best part is, BitBay will handle everything automatically. So Sally does not need to worry about deposits. The \"Templates\" will set those amounts based on recommended levels. She can choose the edit the template and it would show as a \"Custom contract\" There is also auctioning/counter-offer system in BitBay. So they can negotiate everything in advance and everyone can bid on prices!"

Escrow is just a word for an intermediary that holds the paperwork and funds for the execution of the contract. Since there is no escrow agent, the agents themselves are the parties involved. So maybe we need to invent a new word for this. A typical contract can be seen on the blockchain from start to finish. That transaction shows the two inputs from different addresses, their temporary accounts, then also the \"escrow\"/joint account and the release back to the parties. Notice the inputs of 2 and 4 from separate addresses and outputs of 4 and 2 respectively. The bomb is held by both parties and is never broadcasted. However BitBay will automatically submit this bomb AND delete the key to the escrow destroying the funds in two ways if the time limit runs out."

Also it will give me a little more firepower in the future. To make things even better, I paired up with a friend who is helping with all the back end like articles and building and other things to save time. This allows me to focus on coding only. For example, i was able to update the bitbay source with locktimes in a single day! Markets only took me 2 weeks! Templates will take a few more... so things are way faster now. Plus im staying with my friend it makes life easier than when i was traveling too much. So expect public beta in a day or two."

Qt is not multisignature. In fact, this is the only Qt that even uses the watchonly branch which is why it saw your balance, it has your public keys in the file so it can generate the address. So if you arent syncing in the Bitbay smart contracting client it can be for several reasons. First of all, we have updated the source code for this to have permanent nodes. If its been a long time since you have connected, you would not have any good seed nodes. You need the new client. Also, on windows 8 we have noticed some firewall issues. Again you would need the new client. Uninstall BitBay and reinstall with the new link I will be uploading an update tonight. I'm assuming you are on windows? How old is your smart contracting client? Also, as long as you have key1.private and key2.private your funds are safe. Never lose those files. In BitBay wallet.dat is not used. But in Bitbay-Qt, wallet.dat is used so back that up, but only Qt. When we finish staking in Halo, wallet.dat wont even be needed anymore (only for storing copies of public keys)"

It's so funny seeing people boast about how a coin just made them money, just so they can dump it back into BTC, which is nothing more than the roller coaster that got them in the mess.  There is a reason why merchants who accept BTC in payments, cash out to fiat immediately - it's because they can't afford to lose money in the \"long\".  I can't say enough how I can't wait\u00a0 for a pegged system that is simplified for any average Joe to feel comfortable to partake in and with a built-in decentralized marketplace for the sake of \"peace of mind\".  Why, in my right mind, would I utilize BTC as a means of currency, when I have the fear of tomorrow of knowing the possibility that it could dump or skyrocket! This \"dumbness\" needs to end! Yet they can't... don't want to piss off the centralized Debeer's-type POMer's that are waiting for that quick buck, let alone the hackers that are out in force trying to hack 'moran's' without a 'brian' that put their BTC in someone else's hands!

This will take some time to learn and I know that the dev's here are already focused on the 2 key principles of crypto - \"Decentralization\" and \"Ease of Use\". If you don't want to participate in the public beta marketplace client, by all means, just use the wallet for transactions or staking, eventually though, the wallet will become obsolete. As for now... I'm staking my coins with my wallet, and when I get time to play around with the marketplace client, I simply shut down my wallet and try to learn the new system.  Hope this helps!"

I'm wondering if bitmessage wasnt getting a good connection or perhaps has a firewall issue? Im thinking the best way may be to give you a custom bitmessage client that you can run so we can look inside it and see whats going on.  Also, try to double check that your bitmessage address is loaded. Even in Bitbay, it will tell you how many connections you had. Sorry if i overlooked your comment. I get amazingly busy. I'm more than happy to walk you through it on IRC, Skype or email. PM me so we can get you started. To improve Bitmessage, im very soon going to be having a superior seeding system to speed things up."

So far, i have only see this issue once and it was with my build on my computer at a second location. I was unable to see messages that my other setup saw. But it later found peers and fixed itself. I will definitely look into hard coding some peers for the network thats arent native bitmessage nodes.

        "Ok sure. First of all, it works on Bitmessage. You are a node in the network. Everyone will pass messages around to their neighbors and eventually the message will get to you. If you can decrypt it, its for you. No servers needed to run this. However, it may take time the first time you connect to the markets. And after two days, orders are forgotten by the nodes. However, a node can of course send the order again as a reminder to new people once it leaves the market. So first of all, take some time to let the nodes find each other. You have a list of nodes and messages will eventually need to find you. However, once the full list of peers is obtained, things start working very fast. So first, you should check and see if you have a good connection in the receive tab. If you see about 8 or more connections you are good. Next, let it find all the nodes. Sometimes that is very fast and sometimes not. Lastly, go ahead and test sending to the market. If your network is running properly anything you send to the market will show in the market tab. I will send some orders to the market to fill it up a bit. If you want more assistance, please PM me and would be happy to help."

Those are RedHat, Debian, Suse. For instance, anything compiled on Redhat will run on CentOs. The only thing that varies for executables are library linkages, so compiling for any particular distro fixes that. Most all distros you'll ever see are available for free on distrowatch.com. You can just boot them into a VM in virtualbox and do a compile to produce the executables for your code. Easy Peasy. Are you distributing you Linux code as .tgz or native packages?  I take some of that back. Linux does vary by hardware architecture. X86, IBM power Series. You're not going to be running in AIX lpars by any chance, are you?

For linux its a tarball but we make deb files. I've even noticed a difference on Mac platforms. Also, there is the simple fact that 32 and 64 bit is different. We only have 64 bit builds for Linux and Mac. 32 bit for Windows. I used to build windows 64 but regressed to 32 so it would always be the same. I was told 64 bit linux wasnt backwards compatible but have not tested that yet since we only have 64 bit build anyways.

Sadly, pyqt doesnt handle it correctly at least natively from version 4. Its on my bug tracker to be fixed but havent had the time to look into that one.  What i meant by saving data locally was that i dont save bitmessage data in the default datadir in roaming. Instead, i save to install path. I had to change this manually in their source, its not a big deal. Because on a German or Chinese computer, their username may use foreign characters and those would cause Bitmessage to fail. So no, not every bug is so transparent. Of course, in pyqt my solution will be different however there is two folder issues. One being for foreign characters and another being for windows BS security that doesnt let you write to certain directories unless you run as admin. Oh and i almost forgot. I've got an admin hack but it doesnt work on the subprocesses. To blackcoind needs to be run as admin too on certain computers from the terminal/console.

For example, some businesses come to me with interest in using debit cards or perhaps telcom stuff or really its been completely random each deal is different. One guy wants to have me code Halo for large tax swaps (hes a lawyer so his company would be forced to be escrow in this case). To be honest, if a coin wanted markets at this point im not sure what i would say. I'm really busy right now and not ready to take on more work. With that said, if it was in regards to NightTrader then year, the most obvious choice would be awarding coins a Halo for getting a spot within the markets. But it wouldnt exactly go to \"any\" coin. Should a Halo be extended to ALL coins? Should Kittycoin get a Halo? How about Flappycoin? I'm going to have to measure the coin by its community, dev and future. Ive not really decided what is best for the future yet. So i guess any coins interested would just have to talk to me. For now, im going to give a lot of thought to who gets one.

Put all thoughts of licensing to the back of your mind now. Build Bithalo. Make it awesome. Make it polish. Make it so that you get a 6 inch boner every time you think about it. Develop a reputation for being awesome. Make it a masterpiece. Once everyone knows the beauty and power. The demand for their own version will be there. You can license then.

        "I understand your concerns on the matter, but you've got to remember one of the sole concepts of Bitbay - pegging! I used to be a Bitcoin fan and a Blackcoin fan - yet they have no stability.  Blackcoin broke my heart. It's done nothing but drop in value ever since the pump took place. Every time I hoped that it had finally hit its bottom, it just kept going, no matter how sound the dev's are. So the point being is that the crypto market is in dire need of a stable system. Sure, maybe one day Blackcoin will peg as well to maximize Blackhalo. But I don't see Bitcoin ever pegging nor do\u00a0 I see a potential DogeHalo'd coin ever pegging. Maybe it's because of my bias of POS vs's POW, but either way, if another coin screams for a halo system, then by all means let them pay for it. They are going to be so far behind that they will only have slim hope of succeeding.  Why would I commerce on a non-pegged coin in halo? If I want to buy a bar of gold on the bithalo marketplace, one day it might be worth 5 BTC's, yet if I waited a week it might be worth 3 BTC's.  Or if I want to buy my kid a Doge shirt on a potential Dogehalo'd marketplace for Christmas, without a pegged system, I might just be buying that shirt for 4 times the cost if I just waited 3 weeks. The whole instability structure is stupid! This is where I'm so happy to have found Bitbay! It will be the first coin with an amazing halo client that will eventually be stable (pegged) and still decentralized. This will be the first of it's kind.  So I'm not worried if the inventor of Halo wishes to make licensing fees for his rock solid program. He's obviously proven (through all the FUD) over the last few months that he's here to stay! \u00a0 I dare any halo'd coin to try and replicate this coin's current roadmap as that would mean to peg the system to a set price!  This very well could be the future that we've all been waiting for! Can't wait to see where it leads"

Also I have about 5 wallets with a bigger \"B\" if u want, i can share those addresses. I can't even use that wallet because it got mixed with my watchonly wallet. So i have to dump the private keys to remove the coins from QT. I can only stake with it right now. Also the top address is most likely BTER. We found out that it was split between me, Lin and Steven perhaps a few others split BTERs address. If they withdraw from the exchange wallet, it could explain the movement. Regardless, i did a withdraw after BTER got hacked and now only hold about 1% on the exchange. Realize this, if a wallet was selling on an exchange, you wouldnt notice that on the richlist because exchanges don't trade live coins. So its would be hard to tell the difference from a deposit/withdraw for the sake of purchase. Besides, we cant see withdraws in BTC."

I will enjoy the \"tire pressure gauge\" maybe i will frame it. \u00a0 Also to the community, thanks for the support.  funsponge, this has been discussed. And no other coins will be able to buy that license(at least not immediately). After all, wouldnt we want to prove the concept works first? We should prove that it can revive a coin from the depths of hell. Thats way more important than prostituting the tech. Currently, the only thing coins can get is a spot on the NT exchange. That doesnt mean they get markets and wont get pegging. (Ok i did say it depends on what they want but come on man, ive really got to not make the same mistake i made with trusting the guys who brought me into Bitbay) Although the pegging will be something many coins will want, at some point it should open up to support other projects but maybe it should go to projects that deserve it. Like maybe gridcoin(does gridcoin really work?). One day, people will want it open source for obvious security reasons. That is a question of when. Should it only be the obfuscated source? What should the license be to change it, should my company disappear completely and free the tech to the world? Would it be too early and not reach consumers? Will the tech get poisoned with the stigma if its used by people with bad intentions? I'm not sure because ive yet to decide whats best. I know my goal though. My goal is definitely to give consumers tools to eliminate deception. The only licenses that get sold are to companies that want smart contracts. Not to coins especially not after what happened. Even recently just talking to a supporter about a rebrand after the fork for pegging(i wish i could fork the wallets of the bastards, i dont know their addresses).  Its not about money here, its about making good decisions. What decisions should i make? Currently i know the best decision is to exactly finish what i started and definitely do not take on new projects. Finish what ive got on my plate before making any decisions to commit further. Plus these projects are massive in scope. Lots of coding. Even when its done, it could benefit from a full refactor for efficiency. Then again, i dont want to be coding 2 years from now."

This post is cute such enthusiasm ^^, Bitbay is not sad it is actually just getting started and is happy\u00a0   I agree the developer works very hard and this is why Bitbay is happy also.

        "The markets are definitely off chain. The way it works is it leverages Bitmessage channels with modified Bitmessage source. So nodes keep messages in their memory for 2 days. Every node tries to see if it can decrypt any message which basically makes it anonymous. Since you dont know who is decrypting what. There is a header which requires POW. So unlike OB or other systems ddos or flooding is hard to do. And in theory, time locks can be used to circumvent pow altogether. Also, correct me if im mistaken but we are the only markets to be in open beta. Templates will be coming soon. Performance could be speed up dramatically with some server nodes (so can tighter moderation). I dont believe in bloating the blockchain and i think bitmessage chose the correct model for scalable serverless internet. Nodes can easily choose a network of nodes they trust, ports can be changed to subscribe to certain markets, network can route through Tor (and hopefully eventually i2p), and nodes can most likely even link adjacent networks. Reduce bloat at all costs and of course only download what you need to see. Of course i think more modifications can and should be done to Bitmessage. Blockchains are very unnecessary here, you cant download the internet. Bitmessage natively will submit messages again if 2 days pass. Then follow by 4, 8 ,16 and so on. In Halo it might be prudent to make that more frequent while in escrow. Not sure yet, for now i tell people to use encrypted gmail accounts for increased speed during negotiations."

Pump and dump groups will make new coins because its easier to promise features than deliver and i think investors buy in because they want to gamble. I wish that investors wouldnt make it so easy for pump and dump groups to sell new coins. Of course they should be investing in coins with real developement behind them but its not the case. Perhaps if the market matures that will change. This is exactly what the pegging system is going to (try) to solve. Its way too easy to start a new coin and some investors are not thinking about which coins will survive a year from now. Its sad but its true, the majority of the crypto space doesnt care about tech, only money. However, once we give them tools like these markets etc, the hope is eventually people will realize that coins are much more than speculative assets."

Currently anyone who connected in the last week will record the points and the core team knows. Any new users will still see you as new. The other thing i was going to add to this reputation system is that you can keep track of completed orders. And other nodes can (independently) verify your reputation by researching you on the blockchain! If they see that your wallet was only involved in good transactions, they will automatically rate you. If they see your wallet was involved in destroyed escrows, the system can warn them."

So far it looks like that they can manage to bring in some changes. They did in fact make updates to their source. But bringing in core Bitcoin changes is nothing compared to designing markets or wallets from scratch. This is why im only bullish on coins that were written from scratch. SDC does good work, I see that BitShares did some good work... coins with dedicated devs are the ones that should be supported. Also its important to look at dev history. Do they just burn out and cash out? Can the dev stay with the community during hard times? I'm still doing Blackcoin work and BitBay work and will do so until the software is up to our standards regardless of market conditions. Peter Todd is a dev to keep an eye on, the guys from Notary Chains (Paul Snow etc). Lots of good devs in the lurch. But seriously, a coin that comes out of nowhere, pays a signature campaign with fake Bitcointalk accounts (like Bitbay was bombarded with), pumps 10x overnight, doesn't release anything significant to justify the increase other than core commits, is clearly a pump and dump. Who wouldnt sell in this position? 300K volume? In this bear market with BTC at 230? Fake volume is a common trick of these groups. SDC did the same thing without a market released, just a screenshot. But it was a good time to sell. I watched to bots move orders around on Poloniex... its interesting. People dont need to gamble on those coins. However, someone just told me \"they just ride the waves\". Unfortunately, you cant predict when a group is going to sell and if its a pump group, they will sell on their own group."

Instant refund isnt necessary but you should fill out all the other fields. When clicking custom it will fill out the market address let me know if that doesnt fill out. It will also ask you if you want counter-offers. The counter offer system is similar to bidding of course. And for certain auction style contracts, i might have it say place bid instead of counter. Automatically accept is another option it will give you and that basically would be for either pre-screening bidders or disable it so you can accept multiple offers on the same contract. So basically \"custom\" is the only template available and the rest will come soon and the others will be much more friendly. i will try to get more videos in the video library when everything is totally finished.

Of course it confirms the rate with you first. Let me know if it does that for you im not sure what i included in the last update. I will boot up Bitbay, everyone here should be able to see your order.  The markets are sort of empty for now, all the active orders were sold and i know a few expired like the webcam(unless that was also sold). When i finish the templates i will add automatic reposting in the settings so orders can stay alive more than 2 days. Lots to do, then next update will be significant. The next one is all about user friendliness, the program will handle as much as possible for you so no need to think about deposit levels it will make those recommendations."

Pegging to a bankrupt fiat currency thats about to deflate or hyper inflate and die ether way will hinder this project. I would suggest not having a peg because they aren't sustainable. the swiss franc broke its peg tot he euro and made a mess, when china unpegs from the dollar watch out. pegs can look like good ideas but the stress of the markets will break them and that is always messy. bay should be allowed to float and compete along all currencies, the market, smart contracts and features will be its value, volatile at times but necessary because we are volatile creatures.

Pegging to government fiat is a bad idea. if there is going to be a peg, I would suggest using one of the metals because of its steady supply and no risk of huge inflation, just like the supply of bay. how will the holders of bay decide to raise or lower the rolling peg that will affect the spendibility of Bay? This comes across as a currency control that could be detrimental to the project as well. I love the idea of the decentralized market and that's why I'm invested in this project. the only thing that concerns me at this point is the attempt to peg the value and limit spendibility. these are the same anti free market concepts that the central banks are engaged in that will lead to the rejection of their currencies. I think there can be hedging products that are creating with smart contracts sold on a market within bay that involve 2 opposing bets but a system wide valuation peg looks very messy if and when it changes. If we start bay with a peg to USD, how difficult will it be to change that once the dollar goes to shit? my fear is that a peg designed to stabilize the coin will backfire if pegged to extremely volatile shit paper"

When these derivatives break the currencies will go into algo flash crashes as liquidity disappears, we have already seen this happen in the US 10y which is unheard of. There will be more stability in the cryptos because their supply cannot be drastically changed. We are one BANK RUN away from seeing BTC go back to $1,000+ because of it's transferability and limited nature.

Liquidity is not reduced because its reduced for everyone proportionally. So the best way to see it is making supply match demand. If the demand goes down, the supply can be voted on to decrease via deflation. If the demand goes up, then reserves can be made liquid. It happens in increments so no need to fear any crash. In theory, we can grow the price against the dollar via voting. The only thing that is happening here is volatility is dramatically being reduced. If the dollar dies, this coin still exists. Remember only its supply was matching the demand so it could survive any bear market condition. The dream situation is when 1 billion isnt enough coins to match demand. But the theory is, we grow towards that."

        "Yes this is correct. A more technical elaboration is possible. Inputs are required to be tagged as either \"reserve\" or \"liquid\" miners will always calculate wether or not a % of a reserve input is spendable or how much of a liquid input must be tagged as reserve when spent. The concept is simple but making the accounting perfect is a little tricky. If everyone sends to the voting address in request to deflate for example and we start at 100%, then we move to 99%. When an input needs to be spent, lets say its 100 coins then only 99 coins can be used liquid and 1 coin must lock. That coin is only available if the currency inflates back to 100. We will allow for voting after certain intervals of blocks. So perhaps 1-2X per day. Thus in a month at most it can deflate 60%. After 99% we have to figure out what increment makes the most sense. Most like .01% so it would drop 99.99, 99.98 and so on. This effects all wallets. Now consider this is nothing at all like a bank or federal reserve because the rates effect all users evenly. No custodial wallets and no unfair advantages. The beautiful part here is if you have deflated and you hold 100 coins where you used to hold 100,000, then you must have 99,900 in reserve. Your 100 coins will increase in exchange value of course so your purse might be worth more here. If anything it acts as a decentralized economy for the sake of eliminating volatility. However some good arguments were made for allowing reserve sales. So I'm (considering) adding \"time locked sale of reserves\" which is a way to bypass the freeze in the condition that you lock the coins for X months. So if you buy reserves you must wait (lets say the minimum is 3) months. Upon receipt those coins are still reserve but (might) be liquid one day if some arent already and your hope is at the same value. Those bond type sales might create a secondary market and allow investors to enter into the market without making the argument that the distribution was unfair for early adopters. Those reserves would probably get sold at a discount and its a balancing act to decide what the minimum lock should be. Other techniques are still being discussed and nothing is set in stone yet. I know how I'm writing it in the source code but am still meditating on what a good debut will be. Right now, I'm working on templates to commercialize the markets better and make them more user friendly. So far it looks like there are no bugs and the testing has been very smooth. The only thing we are missing is a build that works on all Macs as we notice about 75% of them running. Perhaps we need to include some libraries or something its on my list of things to do."

        "I understand your point. However floating point numbers aren't used in coins. Essentually \"multiplying everyones balance by 10\" is the same as adding a decimal place. Its simply from a math perspective, computers don't handle floating points correct and it will cause errors. The link above explains it simply. Of course ok, so it can be done without impacting the market... there is always a way. Even to make it \"appear\" to move to the right, you still must deal in integers not floats. I see your concern, you are basically saying (what if voters are selfish) and thus they can increase supply by unfreezing? Well yes so the question of the frequency of voting comes in. Perhaps it can halve just like the block reward, perhaps we can allow the master key to message the client if variables like voting frequency need to be changed. I think its more of a balancing act. What is the sweet spot where things will square off and the price can achieve a harmony. The idea that people can sell reserves in time locked sales may help act as a deterrent for selfish votes. Also with checklocktimeverify it should be possible to park your coins. This would mean that even on an interest increase those coins would stay parked until the locktime runs out. That would be a voluntary action. Coins that get sold from selfish votes might move into the hands of people who would vote deflation anyways. The point is, the first iteration of this must exist. It certainly would decrease volatility though since no matter how you structure your argument, a dumpers coins will not be all available at once. Perhaps you could argue that overdeflating could cause this risk if the coin is inflated too early. The theory is to have supply matching demand and there is some variables to consider. Think of it this way, Bitcoin is supposed to be hailed as programmable money but they aren't taking advantage of their wonderful opportunity to programatically control their economy. No matter what, this is the next logical step for Bitcoin."

        "This is only to mitigate volatility. It certainly is not always changing though. The core concept is pretty much set. I see your point there but in a bear market a coin can lose 90% of its value and nobody can buy/sell on a market while thats happening. So this engine I'm designing will prevent loss of value in your coins so the markets can be happy. After all, right now we have working smart contracts and decentralized markets with no fees and no arbiters. You would think its perfect. After all even BitHalo had smart contracts for an entire year. People are waiting for templates so its user friendly I think. Although we did have at least 20 deals on the markets go through.  Remember this system is decentralized. There is no reason votes can't be automated or augmented based on node performance instead of stakeholders."

        "Hi Inotanewbie Here you go.... To change the exchange (e.g. for BTER, just replace \"bittrex\" with \"bter\" in the URL). If you switch to the 4-hour chart which is a reasonably medium range view (2-3 weeks) you can see it double-peaked around 170-180. Then it corrected down to 105 and is currently sitting around 115. The rise was off 70-80 so the correction has traced back a good 70% at least which is a fair consolidation. The momentum (see MACD, bottom graph) also indicates that the two corrections have completed (at least as far as the 4-hour chart is concerned). Given all this, + reasonable order book demand + reasonable fundamentals (most things are still ahead of us than behind), I'd say there's reason for calling this the bottom for now. But anything can happen. A big holder could get impatient and just dump everything back down to 70. I can't see it going below that for now though. As I say - don't bet the house on it but I'm in the market for a few at this price. One thing that does look very promising is the fact that the On Balance Volume has been trending up the whole time through the corrections and if anything seems to be moving slightly against the latter downward price movement. I'll restrain myself from drawing too extreme a conclusion from that in a public post, but lets just say I wouldn't be selling at this price \u00a0 h.t.h. ! P.S. Just checked - I've had a buy order in at 115 for the last 3 hours and not a nibble. I didn't get 1 bay. They'r all going for 120 and above."

        "I just topped off a mil this morning and I'm holding till i can actually purchase things I want in the markets. I like this project and SDC, also bought a little BLK. I've been studying currency structures since 08 and with the introduction of BTC I see a turn key alternative to the dollar when it crashes. We don't need to fight the FED or government, just ignoring them and using something they can't control is the way out of this debt based slave system. Decentralized free markets will be key. \u00a0I would like to find a coin that allows me to say for example, I have 10 ounces of silver which I want to use to launch a new silver backed crypto coin called S-coin. I can create 311 S-coins, 1 coin per gram peg. I then spend those into my local economy with the stipulation that anyone can come to me with an accumulated amount of S-coin, say 31.1 minimum and they can redeem that crypto for my physical metal. Those 31.1 coins would then be destroyed by the issuer. New coins can always be created and destroyed as the size of the stack changes with physical deposits and redemption's. It would have to be based on trust with maybe a reputation system of the issuer but it could include a way of verifying by way of third party audits or it could even be as simple as posting a youtube video of the stack every week. This would allow that 1 gram of metal to be divided into 100 million pieces, something not possible in the physical world and it would have all the benefits of instant electronic transfer and blockchain accounting of how much of the coin has been created and make sure it matches the latest youtube stack update. These commodity backed coins could be created by companies that actually produce the product they are selling whether it be oil, gold, or beef. And its got to be as easy as creating a craigslist ad or ebay posting. Let me know if you know of one or is this the colored coin idea, could this be incorporated into bitbay somehow??? I thought counterparty was going down this road but I don't know if anything is ready or not"

Consider that a person could issue \"Johncoin\" where the guy might issue 1000 coins backed by 1000 dollars. True, it wouldn't have a high marketcap but the concept is to issue coins based on market pegs, contracts or deposits. You should avoid audits at all costs. Youtube videos or \"he said/she said\" is the thing of the past. We should move to an economy not based on trust since absolute power corrupts.

He deposts 1 mil and so does the buyer (there is also the 1 mil amount advanced). Thus sellers in for 2 mil buyer is in for 1. Buy sends cash any way he wants (paypal ok but wait at least 30 days or open a support ticket to avoid chargeback) for example, bank wire, cash in the mail, money wire like Western Union, MoneyGram etc. That wire covers 1 million and now buyer is out 2 seller is out 1 (1+1 deposit - cash which was 1) So both parties have to confirm the deal and release to get their money out. We won't automate the wire but we can set up a template that fills in all the forms for any payment option. Things like wire info or western union info and the buyer would fill out their half as well. To illustrate how the balance shifts its like this 2:1 1:2 even (contract complete)"

It's difficult to move USD around. Look at coinbase. You need full ID and a bank account that will accept transfers in and out from them specifically.\u00a0 If you further ID with a VISA card, they'll front you the BTC on demand. Where will that interface exist? Who will you have to trust to have access to your USD bank account for an exchange between USD and BAY to take place? I'm not sure I'd be willing to open my USD bank account and supply personal information as part of getting an account at bittrex or any other altcoin exchange. I'm just not sure how any of that would work. There's a place where crypto addresses and real money get exchanged, like coinbase or circle, but who will be handling that exchange between bay and $$?"

If you want, I will walk you through how to do it we can do a cash deal right now if you want. Basically, a person selling cash would not need a drivers license or photo id or anything like this. Thats up to the seller and i highly doubt they will care. Here is the various way cash can get done in the markets. Most common: Wire transfer - Buyer supplies checking account number and bank name, seller wires funds. Everyone releases deposits. Western Union - Buyer gives name and country of cash pick up. Seller sends western union, gives confirmation number. Deposits released after cash is picked up. MoneyGram - Exactly like western union Cash in the mail(your mom doesnt need to know the address) - Buyer gives address. Seller sends cash in mail and insures it with carrier. Buyer gets it, deposits released. Prepaid credit cards - Buyer gives prepaid credit card information. Seller refills card. Deposits released. No as common, risky due to chargebacks(personally not recommend): Credit card - Buyer allows for credit card funding, seller makes payment (with possible hold). Deposits released. Paypal - Buyer gives paypal etc. Anyone can be a cash seller, so it is clearly the sellers responsibility if they want to do large volume, they will have their own know your customer policies. But many countries dont have those and most people wont care. Hope that explains it, its by far the most superior way to transfer cash. ALSO... You are NOT doxxing yourself at all!! The information you send will only be known by the seller. If you only want to reveal an address for cash in the mail then do that. If you want to only give your name for western union, do that. The information is ENCRYPTED so only the other party knows"

I go to coinbase and press a couple of buttons and I can ask for $38 worth of BTC and mash the button and it says OK. [ Insert 30-60 minute wait for confirmations ]You now have $38 worth of BTC. That's it. When you tell me I can exchange USD for BAY, I expect to be hooked up with a buy/sell button to exchange $38 for BAY. Press the button, it says OK and the BAY are in my wallet. If the exchange of $$ > BAY is more difficult than $$ > BTC, then what am I gaining by using BAY? I'll stick with BTC because it's easier.  I think of it like this. I can teach my 10 year grandkid to buy BTC in my coinbase account in less than an hour. You have said that I will be able to exchange USD for BAY in the client.

Specifically,   which is a google ip address that used to give a quick response for slow internet. I noticed that link has been down. My new version im working on also checks google.com if that fails i suppose i could also check to see if we connected to any nodes on the network as an alternative although that isnt immediate. So yeah, it should synchronize even if it says 0% i know thats sort of strange however, that address should come back online. If it thinks its not connected to the internet it wont get the time online and thus will not be able to calculate an estimated block height(of course it can also use the computers timestamp but its always best to have 2 because of differences in timestamps). Anyways, let me know if that node goes back online otherwise it will be in the next update. If it is stuck at block 80640, you could try restarting your client. Just exit and come back in.

If so, what sort of incentives will users have to become moderators? 3) How would you support anonymity... i mean interms of obfuscating IP addresses not necessarily encrypting messages which come OOTB with BitHalo."

        "Yeah you can do offline sales absolutely. At some point, you need to broadcast though. This in effect is better than blockchain versions because its peer to peer. This really avoids blockchain bloat. Although Bitmessage itself could get bloated. However in that case changing/adding ports, establishing whitelists and dividing markets will solve that issue. Link markets dynamically the way the internet currently does. Currently, moderation is used to delete offers for highly illegal things not censor them (that would be impossible since everything is encrypted coming in unless every offer was reviewed in advance). Obviously we dont want organ trading and other crazy things on there. Lets do our best keep this clean so we can reach the masses. Of course we cant possibly know all the markets because bitmessage decryption keys are based off the market name. So a moderator broadcasts a message to say a market or an order should be ignored. However, a node would have to be connected to see that. Nodes that dont connect within the 2 day period will simply not see it. A permanent ban can happen by checking a server and eventually a burn address can be used. Incentive for moderation is just based on good behavior and constant connectivity. A merchant who always uses the markets and does great can be issued the moderation key. If you place that key in the folder your version of Halo is instantly converted to the mod version with extra options. This system is extremely anon. The IP addresses are encrypted with a supermoderator key. So only I hold that one and it can be used for very positive reasons. For example, a node who is always connected can be added to knownnodes.dat in bitmessage so we have faster markets(without revealing the ip itself). However consider that I only can see an ip address of a market that im connected to. If something happens in a market I dont see it would be impossible to log that due to the nature of Bitmessage. And ive never bothered to decrypt them anyways because we are not big enough to need the performance boost of new known nodes. Its like triple anomynoty. First with bitmessages encryption then we encrypt again in Halo and finally the p2p negotiations are encrypted with there key. So unless you are a peer to a transaction there is absolutely no way to intervene. I should add, if you use Tor with Bitmessage or Bitcoin you lose all of your anomynoty. There is some great articles on that. In fact it even opens you up to some really powerful attacks by controlling exit nodes. So I'm looking forward to developements in i2p and mesh(people can always add Tor manually to their config file but i dont recommend it)."

        "Great question! We recommend that you keep the client on during negotiations. If its responding to an offer it will time out after a couple days. We also recommend you use encrypted email instead of bitmessage during a p2p negotiation for reliability and speed. However bitmessage itself will send messages again until they have been received but i have to admit I'm not sure I like their protocol and might change it. They send 2 days then 4 then 8 so there are gaps I think. Instead for now the way to fill that in if you chose to use Bitmessage during negotiations is for the client to automatically resend the message. Also, for timeouts all my templates will give a lot of extra time to plan for delays. You can extend time of escrow by mutual agreement."

        "Yeah this is eventually the plan. I was even thinking of having a permanent shop for trusted suppliers. So people who want to sell millions in volume can contact us and get on a special list so their listings are always in the client. Regardless, I'm trying to finish templates first so all the forms are user friendly. In fact, once i finish an api, why cant we make a little program that does affiliate orders. So somehow a user can place ebay orders from other suppliers in BitBay that they would be willing to broker? This was we can wire through popular providers. IF there was a gateway. The thing is, it might be a little bit more expensive since the person reselling will want to mark up any item. However, it does populate the markets and i think thats kind of cool."

Make a attainable roadmap, with realistic steps and goals. \u00a0Release products in timely fashion, and I am sure price will go up, which in turn,will bring in more crowds. \u00a0 Let me tell you, you want to be Ebay of Crypto land. \u00a0Ebay had first comer advantage and no one can challenge that anymore. \u00a0Bitbay also has potential to be one. \u00a0But time is of essence and lots competitor are cropping up. \u00a0Do it or become irrelevant. \u00a0Simple."

        "Yes it is the same blockchain, all accounts are multisig. However the decentralized markets run off the blockchain to prevent bloating. The contracts have been functional for over one year tried and tested(Its BitHalo/BlackHalo). So you are in good hands. The markets are functional, im happy to do a contract with you. If you wish to post to the markets, please use \"Custom Contract\" template. I dont control the op but i will let the slack group know that we should have some nice diagrams. Price should go up when pegging/hedging is finished. However personally within the next month or two should be a good time to buy(thats only my opinion, i dont trade coins). I dont give people \"hope and imagination\" im sorry man, ive always given people concrete products. I cant stand hype and vaporware. You already CAN post and make sales of any kind, you can hire barter trade coins whatever you want right now using the custom template. Just make deposits equal to the amount. AND you can type the amounts in Dollars it will automatically detect the market price and convert it. There will be a decentralized coin exchange. You can look up NightTrader and that runs through BlackHalo and BitBay will be supported. However its not going to be finished until the templates are done. I understand simple but simple and decentralization are actually complex to combine. For example for a cellphone app, you would need servers since phones don't have enough memory to run a program like this. However I think the \"templates\" will be the simple you are looking for. No other coin will make Halo \"irrelevant\" since Halo is the only smart contracting platform available right now and its been around for one full year. In my opinion there will always be people who enjoy the software and it will always be a part of crypto. Software takes time and patience and thats why you see almost no competitors(other projects arent being honest or are trying to be dark markets). Also, Apple has billions of dollars to put into UI, Halo/BitBay has only one coder and you are talking to him. This is my best effort to keep it simple   ... like the setup wizard for example. Thank you for the suggestions and support! Please let me know any feedback you have, its helpful."

Unless you are targeting corporation/business market, you would need to do mass marketing. \u00a0Either tried and true marketing blitz which cost lots of money or something like viral marketing. \u00a0Either way, its full time work and doubt if you can do it all alone, coding, relations, marketing etc etc. Or, price goes up. All problem solved. \u00a0When people realize what a solid wallet you have, they will be thrilled. \u00a0But first they need to come and rising price will get their attention. Perhaps Bitbay coin price fluctuation isn't your concern and it shouldn't be, but remember more supporters you have, more help you will have and words can spread faster. \u00a0I myself only came about your coin during my routine 700 pages coin chart scan. \u00a0Other wise, I would have never heard of it. \u00a0Trust me, price goes up, boards will be filled and more converts will show up. \u00a0Some of them might even start lending hands or donations or start listing contracts. \u00a0Who knows. I know for sure at least beefed up OP page will help. \u00a0Use lots of cool graphics and plainly laid out road map with past accomplishments. \u00a0Put in dates too if possible. \u00a0Basically its same information but laid out better with cooler graphics. \u00a0Check out EKN op page (   ). \u00a0Mostly its copycat vaporware with thin promises, not like Bitbay with solid product, and yet I bought in for quick ride because I know crowds will buy into it. \u00a0I bet you EKN will be has been in few months with missing dev. \u00a0But point is, people are people and they like cool looking stuff. \u00a0Just look how long EKNs OP page is. \u00a0Picture tells thousand words, and this is reason why corportions spends billions on marketing, letting people know what a great product they have. \u00a0 I am willing to donate some coins for graphic artist to \"renovate\" OP, and list some item when \"template\" is finished and off the beta status. \u00a0 It seems to me that perhaps you are perfectionist, trait that I admire, but seriously consider bring out the core product out of beta, cut out all the excess for future development, laid it out on roadmap on revamped OP page. \u00a0At least this will clearly show advanced wallet that you have. \u00a0Right now, you don't even have screen shot of beta wallet. \u00a0sigh. I am speculator/investor so I do not mind dips( actually I love it), but clearer presentation will benefit whole community. \u00a0Bitbay is one of my few long term holds and will add more when I see dips and funds become available."

As for pegging system, I do not quite fully understand but it will be pegged to dollar? \u00a0And supply of Bitbay will be controlled by locking them in wallet or releasing them? \u00a0I do like the concept of stability on the Bitbay so that advertised price on contract stays same value, however I do see few of problem. First, dollar isn't stable. \u00a0Its floating fiat currency just like any others like yuan yen or euros. \u00a0In us market no problem, but in international market, value of dollar fluctuates. \u00a0US dollar is somewhat stable now and hold world reserve currency status, but for how long? \u00a0USA is trillions in debt and can't increase interest rate higher than 1% which will crush the gov budget? \u00a0US gov, as any other major government out there, will have no choice to keep inflationary policy to lessen its debt load way \u00a0way way into future. \u00a0Its position as world reserve currency and petro dollar is weakening. \u00a0In fact IMF is proposing SDR or new world currency to replace US dollar. So if you are looking out 10 years down the road, this could be problem. Second, the implementation of control on Bitbay. \u00a0How will you lock the supply? \u00a0Meaning I can't spend it? \u00a0Chee thanks alot. \u00a0Locking Bitbay will lower its supply and price goes up relative to dollar. \u00a0But when everyone goes crazy about Bitbay and wants to have some, Bitbay will get stronger in terms of dollar. \u00a0Then you can either release the supply of Bitbay from\u00a0 wallet or bring down the supply of dollar, which we know isn't option. \u00a0But if all the Bitbays from wallets are released and demand is still too strong, Bitbay will go up higher in exchanges, via btc purchases, thus imbalance could ensue. \u00a0This also could happen if dollar value plumets, however unlikely it is. I am sure you have thought about all this already, but I think it should be given more consideration before implemented. \u00a0Maybe \u00a0Bitbay 5.0? For now, exchange ratio can be shown on wallet in Bitbay, BTC and dollar? \u00a0 \u00a0As for the problem of seller constantly needing to readjust its price, maybe let them sell in any of three, \u00a0bitbay, btc, or dollar. \u00a0And buyer will have to make calculation on exchange rate. \u00a0 In general many worlds currencies were tied to one another, like dollars and euros with mixed results. \u00a0Recently, I think switzerland unpegged from euros and saw its value wildly appreciate against euros and other currencies, causing \u00a0major disruption. Overall I am bit pessimistic about it."

        "Its a Bitbay address. Bitcoin addresses always start with a \"1\" or a \"3\". Hey thanks for the donation, will make sure to use it towards some nice infographics and marketing materials.  Currently, exchange value for BitBay and USD can be seen. Simply click on the \"$\" sign at the home page   ... in the templates it depends on the template but dollar or Bay can be used. Wether or not it adjusts will depend on the template. Buyer doesnt need to calculate exchange rate in that case, just confirm it. As for pegging you are close. However the idea of it being pegged to a dollar is a very old notion (perhaps this is one of the things that shoudl be updated in the OP). This system allows for a \"rolling peg\" so we can roll up the floor if we need to be deflating or if it goes up naturally thats ok as long as its stable. This concern over the \"dollar getting weak\" is exactly why the system is designed this way. The major key is not to deflate too fast. Either way, if deflated, you inflate as long as the volume and demand is there, the price should be perfectly stable. Imagine how exciting things will be IF the price can go to a dollar 100% inflated! So the point is not to force it but we are searching for a solution that makes both investors and users of the market happy. Mostly limit volatility and allow long term growth. (Why not go higher than a dollar after a few years? Only time will tell and its too early to make promises) So yes the idea of $1 is an extinct notion. The rolling peg may just start at ICO price and gradually deflate. The community should engage in discussion because this is an economic tool delving deep into economic theory. Munti is by far the best one to ask about this, economics is his specialty and he has given me some helpful advice on the subject. We are still talking about all the possible scenarios and best ways to use the tools. You point about \"some of your bay being frozen\" is 100% correct. Its not a voluntary freeze, it's mandatory. However, if you make accounts reflect their prices in BTC/Fiat then that amount should remain stable and perhaps is a more user friendly display. The maximum deflation might be 1-2% per day. That has not been decided yet. Perhaps clients will choose to vote based on a math algorithm, we still need to run tests. Lets say for example you have 100 coins. If after 1 month it deflates 50% to hit a target (perhaps ICO price) then you will have 50 reserve and 50 liquid. Those liquid coins should be worth more though in theory because supply went down. The voting is decentralized. If the community decides that deflation is stable it wont change much from 50/50. If it inflates you can sell the reserve. If you want to sell reserve we are considering adding a 3-6 month time locked sale. This prevents is from having the same properties as the liquid coins and also gives it some similarities to a future. Perhaps locked coins will get sold at a discount. Only a person who plans on holding bay for years would want that OR maybe a person doing a sort of credit swap and they dont want to damage the market?! In my opinion this feature is what Bitcoin is missing. That and speed and time locks(and hell 20 other things)."

        "First of all, fiat is showing a long history of failed pegs. This is not because pegging in it self can not be done, but because the consequences of maintaining a peg that is not matched by economic realities are so big. The value of a currency directly effects unemployment rate, tax systems and so on. For Bay it is a little easier. We only need to consider stability, effect for consumers and merchants, and investor reactions. We have chosen to peg to the dollar because it is the world reserve currency, and thus big enough to be relatively stable (nothing has ever had a stable value). Doomsayers telling everyone how the dollar is about to crash is nothing new. I have heard that for twenty years now. Some day they might be right, but it's not likely to happen in any near future, or else the dollar would be a lot cheaper already. We could of course chose to peg to a mix of currencies to get it more stable, but that would require a team of experts to constantly balance and rebalance the mix we peg to. We don't think that is required to get a peg that is stable enough for our needs. If/when the dollar crashes, or some other currency becomes world reserve, it will be easy to peg to any other currency instead of USD. Yes, controlling the supply is our most important tool to be able to maintain the peg. There will be a few support systems, so we don't have to change the amount of available bay for every minor fluctuation.  There is no reason to be worried about getting your coins locked. If we started pegging to day at say $0.01 and locked 90% of all Bay, you could sell your liquid 10% for more bitcoin or dollars than you can sell your whole bag for at the moment. Big demand for Bay after all bay are released is also not a problem. We are talking about a rolling peg. Meaning the peg will change over time. So we are talking relative stability. We are not gonna pick a number like say $ 1 and declare that will be the value of Bay forever. Our goal is to get Bay stable enough for the market to function for ordinary people. So we will start low, and let the value increase as Bay gets more adapted. Only we do it in defined steps instead of letting it fluctuate wildly. Again, we do this so it is more predictable for people who use Bay for real world business.  For an investor the big difference compared to an unpegged coin, is that the advantage is bigger for those that come in early. If you buy nextbigcoin for 100 sat and sell at 200, you have made a 100% profit. But then you are out. In Bay you can have the same profit selling liquid coins, but still have say 80% of your coins. They may be locked atm, but when more are released you can take profit again. Overall there is no reason to be pessimistic about it"

        "I pickuped up about a mil more bay and more orders placed. \u00a0It is significantly undervalued IMHO. BTW, on the subject of pegging to dollar for stability etc is still impractical \u00a0to implement at this stage of platform development. It is up for much debate. \u00a0It could help weather from possible demise of bitcoin, but to me it seems nothing more than academical theoretical exercise. If dev wants this platform to have wide acceptance, its not pegging but whether product serves a useful function that people need. What will it do for us? \u00a0If you want to sell, there is Ebay. \u00a0If you want to order from China, there is Alibaba. \u00a0And others like Amazons, etc they all wants to sell something.  What makes Bitbay stand out? \u00a0What market will we serve.? \u00a0How can it do thing better that whats out there already? \u00a0 I think these needs to be answered first. If you expect people to start listing stuffs like what Ebay sells on Bitbay, its naive expectation. \u00a0First of all, crypto community is small. Not many buyers and sellers from there. \u00a0No one will list, no one will buy. \u00a0If I want to sell something, I will go Ebay, Amazon or Craigslist. \u00a0Its already established and perceived risk is low. \u00a0Are we shooting for \u00a0general population? \u00a0Is it possible at all without spending millions of dollar in ad funds to bring up awareness? How about commercial/industrial market? \u00a0Can this platform be middle men for international trade? such as raw materials? \u00a0What would be required to reach such market? \u00a0What are the existing competitor at the sector? Well there always dark market. \u00a0Its up to dev how far he is willing to go on it. \u00a0No pedo? No organs? How about medical pot extracts? \u00a0drugs? \u00a0Sex toys? How about tourism/hotel market. \u00a0There are lots of internet based private lodging accomodations. Maybe a \"dark pool\" type coin exchange? Where crypto coin can be bought in bulk without effecting market price? What I am saying is that just because we built it, people wont just come. \u00a0We need to focus on market that our platform's advantage can shine. \u00a0Once we have firm footing there, maybe wonderful things might happen, new market may develop that we never thought about. \u00a0Populations awareness of our product will slowly increase and possibly see more diverse activities. \u00a0As we grow, we will be noticed more and even receive some press coverage which will bring in more users. I believe that if Bitbay platform is found to be useful, and serves certain core markets, whether bitcoin/cryto sector dies or not, will be irrelevant. As of now, I feel as if Bitbay is a boat wondering on vast ocean not knowing where to dock at. \u00a0 \u00a0 We need clearer direction and list all our intentionons on OP so that more of crypto communities becomes aware of our efforts, and goal. Our dev has excellent coding skills and I have full confidence in him to release great looking useful product, \u00a0but if no one know about our products, what will it do?  I have made a small donation for facelift on our op. \u00a0Please join in, and donate Bitbay to: B6HtsEuEQfzJTsf751xFj11DpuFjzQfgiS We will have higher crypto community awareness of our project."

So you can see if they cancelled, confirmed or blew up any contracts  Ive still got to finish building that part out though. For now it just shows profiles. I'm going to give the community a chance to chime in on your post above. There are clearly advantages to ebay and freelancer like not paying fees for one. Also, there is no theft as opposed to ebay which succumbs to scams. Also Freelancer to hire has problems with lazy employees whereas the advantage in Halo or BitBay is the deposit forces them to perform. Coin exchange is on NT exchange will be released soon.

        "Ok cool thanks! And good luck on you project, there a lot of text I don't have the time yet to look over all of it. Perhaps on day we could chat about markets and stuff. Ive always thought about plugging BitBay into existing sites. Its always possible to put an api in. Personally, from all that data that gets transacted in one contract I can say its took expensive to store that on a blockchain and will bloat very fast. Like if i put all the contract data on blockchain it would be about 100-200 outputs with 6a. Also, bloating in blockchain size is not going to be your primary issue but simply bandwidth issues. If the markets are popular, they wont scale because if its 10k+ per contract(not including the image) then this can bring your blockchain to a crawl. This doesnt include images. Images need to be heavily compressed. Halo compresses images to 10kb no matter if its a 3 mb image or 20 mb image. Also, you can perform contracts without being connected, you just need to reconnect eventually. Even if you use the blockchain, you need to be connected to sign anything no matter what method you use."

Spv can be used to reduce bandwidth.. New designs from Bitcoin devs will allow sending only your UTXOs without sacrificing security of spv aswell as reduce bandwith to kbs Smart contracts will work on the network ready to sign.. They would work offline but yes to sign you would connect and it would send off. IMO it's better than working offline in p2p system because of the random times it rebroadcasts after the pruning cutoff time limit (2 days)... I was thinking same thing.. We have a lot to discuss. Personally if bloat is solved via pruning then blockchain really doesn't have any \u00a0drawbacks"

        "it depends on how you are doing the markets. Bitmessage could do offline transactions with dedicated servers thats no different from SPV in theory. SPV can be insecure due to not confirming enough blocks. It may be more susceptible to botnet attacks. Like for BitHalo, i rely on Biteasy, Electrum and Blockchain.info servers to avoid downloading the blockchain but imagine if they get something wrong like the size of an input. Then it could cause loss of coins. In BitBay, even with 10kb images, we use anonymous pastebins. The big advantage is not having bloat. Its my primary argument against Etherium. For example you can do distributed p2p smart contracts with hashes of approved code that can be downloaded via torrent for full nodes. Anyways... this link is something you and all of us should take seriously. Bitcoin has serious scaling issues forget markets even storing coins is a logistical nightmare if you plan on really calling it \"decentralized\" That article only considers VISA transactions but market orders with full descriptions of products, custom settings etc would have to make it 10x bigger. Meaning nobody can download 10mb per second and if they arent connected for a few days they will never catch up. In other words its impossible to scale in a decentralized way. You need to be able to divide the network into sections either by using different ports and linking those with servers or something. And dont even get me started with man in the middle, controlling exit nodes, botnet, sybil, sharing fake data with botnet and other attacks. Bitcoin is extremely fragile already, so reliance spv is not the solution. In many ways these problems are not solved yet not even for bitmessage. There are advantages though to not having a blockchain."

        "Right but you must place not only trust of your transactions getting relayed properly but also pay fees for using those dedicated servers for incentive to execute other's transactions. This is what OpenBazaar does through arbiter nodes to resolve disputes or to relay transactions.  SPV makes sense if you are a new user or aren't syncing existing transactions, even then it is able to confirm your UTXO's since usually that is all you really care about. If you want your spent outputs you can reindex the entire chain. For existing users, they have already synced and can now prune their chains to reduce blockchain size (some may not, some may enable pruning). Depends on the hardware they are running on. Regarding scalaibility yes I believe Gaven is addressing not only releasing the block size constraint but thinking of ways to solve the bandwidth issue, SPV reduces network trust but makes sense for thin clients.. and the mechanism I told you about before by being able to confirm your UTXO's reducing bandwidth to kb's instead of mb's is just an example that many people are working towards solving the issues and I'm confident they will and when they do, we can simply reap the benefits of the solutions because we share codebases. The big advantages of using the blockchain I believe will start showing as we do more integration work, that would be not only more complex but impractical to do via the P2P approach... however I do believe you know what you are doing and can solve any issue its just a matter of development time, and leveraging others work that you trust is critical in trying to achieve the network effect which is essentially the end game for all projects except the one that gets it. The elegance and genius of Satoshi usually will not show itself inherently until you try to use it and integrate with it for new ideas that people would have thought would have been better suited with existing decentralised technologies. Infact like I said in the blog, he actually had a marketplace stub implementation in the 0.1 reference qt client but was incomplete.. its obviously alot of grunt work for him and he probably thought his time was best served in other areas of interest and rightfully so. Also what you have to understand is that the service of offers in the blockchain is not meant to be analogous to the spending of currency which is expected to have higher velocity, so to match VISA speed requirements would obviously not be a very fair comparison since I don't believe that the e-commerce marketplace has the need to transact at the same speed as a currency transaction, unless you talk about paying the offer which offers no metadata and is streamlined to be a simple transaction from the bitcoin core so 8 mb/s required for VISA speeds for paying offers. What you talk about is not a \"Bitcoin\" problem per se but it is the P2P layer that will not be able to handle transactions fast enough and becomes a bottlenecks compared to VISA. It becomes a problem of Memory bloat if you have transactions filling up the mempool but not confirming fast enough to avoid the mempool from taking up all the available memory in the system. Since you would keep tx's around for 2 days wouldn't it also be a problem with BitHalo/BitMessage? If 2 days is a cutoff and the transactions are piling ontop faster than they can be processed you will have a case where they are not queued any longer and you lost those transactions. Since P2P markets take up considerable more bandwidth than their blockchain counterparts it will become a bigger problem in the P2P implementation than it will ever be in the blockchain version."

        "Well actually, the market itself does not have to be decentralized in every case. i know that may seem off topic, but you know, being able to pull data from Ebay may be what gets the network effect fastest. The way BitBay works with Bitmessage orders is by signing the entire json dictionary which gets hashed using a special json hashing function to order it and then signed with your private key. Thats pretty much identical to how Bitcoin works under the hood but more flexible. However in this case a bit faster because you arent signing every input. After all, you are only trying to verify that you are not spoofing data and not man in the middle. A blockchain IS a p2p system. Period. We are comparing apples to apples haha. Bitmessage just doesnt hold on to data for more than 2 days. However services to hold on to that data and hash it in the form of a notary chain, burn to a blockchain can be extremely secure since the hash must exactly match. Also since the market data is signed identical to a bitcoin transaction at least in my implementation, there is absolutely no reason you cant have master nodes etc. Of course you can also burn it but this is just a value added option. Me and Vitalik discussed this today and he seemed to have the same idea as you which is \"eventually they will solve it\". I'm not really waiting for the issue to get solved, i simply did it the way i knew could work now.  There is no solution yet, if Bitcoin had to scale to visa sizes today it would fail. Lets agree that BTC needs a full rewrite. I personally wish i had the time to do that in python. Regardless, you are right, it can definitely be written better more elegant for scaling issues and i think blockchains can be reduced 10x in size for bandwidth and 1000x in size for storage. But then sime bandwidth problems persist... how can one make a letter/char less than 8 bits?! Maybe one day we will move beyond a binary system where frequencies are measured and have some sort of base 10+ system. Here Bitmessage and any other implementation will face a similar problem but has the advantage of switching ports if the traffic is too unbearable. Also perhaps having something signed in the header to make traffic more specialized. Header data first explaining categories, one network for reading the search query etc. So we can break it up too. This is all just a data management issue. Like, how would a mesh network handle all of its own issues. We are heading towards a p2p society, blockchains are p2p and so are markets, the concept is to break data management into pieces, magnet links, ports what is needed to streamline this to scale to surpass current bottlenecks. 2 days is an arbitrary limitation and i can change that in the code if we have to and run on another port. Perhaps even change how messages are held or pruned, access knownnodes.dat and add ips that are from the network and trusted and even have a full seeder that scans the entire internet with the zmap library. Lots to discuss, and lots of ways to solve the problem. This reminds me, SPV might be very useful for my decentralized exchange NightTrader. Ive got to learn a bit more about it and how to run those nodes because in the case of decentralized exchange with 20 different coins we dont want to force everyone to download each blockchain they trade in (if they really dont want to wait). So yeah it has its place and confirming blocks even if not the full blockchain still wards off basic attacks. You and me both know, sybil and botnet is a problem with or without spv and Gavin would agree with me im sure there is absolutely no solution yet. Some trust is still required. By the way, i do realize you grouped some of the competitors into the same category but it may be confusing to a reader. Obviously BitHalo/BlackHalo and BitBay dont have the fee structure problem of OpenBazaar and we dont have the Escrow problem of OB. If you guys do an escrow PLEASE do 2 of 2. Dont do 2 of 3 or you risk collusion attacks (escrow agents getting involved in their own deals and taking the coins). Also remember escrow agents cant determine who is lying and NEVER will be able to determine who is lying no matter how advanced technology gets. So please use 2 of 2 as an option its the only reason i got into bitcoin. You cant have decentralized money with centralized escrow services. That 3rd party has got to go."

        "Fully agree about trustless escrow.. we have a design for that. I quite like your escrow system and we had a similar concept that I talk about in the blog with an excerpt \u00a0of our design document. Locking coins as collateral makes it trustless... It's a bit more involved than simply locking 2x coins on each side however, its next to do on our list. About grouping competitors, I grouped based on p2p vs blockchain and I also talk about your impelemtations apart from other projects. I spoke about the escrow system you put in place and talked about the pegging mechanism and that I watch with interest. I think we do think alike in many senses just that my views of the integration of the marketplace technology differs slightly from yours. For example an ebay API integration would be sweet but not highest on my priority list since people selling on ebay would like to use ebay since customers know about ebay, they will visit the site and don't know about the custom interface you've created which is hosted on xyz.com. Sure for a merchant it saves costs, and cheaper transactiosn for consumers but it doesnt have network effect to take marketshare away from ebay, and you would need to spend millions of $ in marketing to make that happen. Instead IMO a cheaper alternative to reach the network effect would be if I \u00a0focus on trying to integrate the technology in existing web infrastructure so that you can be running your e-commerce website and simply enable the integration without redirecting customers to some other interface... we both agree UX work is not only hard but time consuming with several interations of reviews required by customers in order to \"get it right\"... my thinking was always to try to maximize the amount of \"good\" work that is already done and build on top of it. The most common shopping carts have PUSH API's that can be built into (in fact I've intergrated about 11 of them for the bitshares project as payment gateways so I know them quite well, see  )... I don't think ebay has a push API but if it does great, thats exactly what I need/want although I think you are talking about a PULL api to extract info from a system to reuse in another application. It was a cool experience doing those payment gateways (I am still integrating more as being a bitshares delegate) and it shaped my thinking into what it is now about using marketplace and building it as a gateway plugins into other softwares."

Very soon a template system will be injected into the client that will make the system even easier to create contracts. In the beta client, there is only the custom contract system usable. As the beta client upgrades and incorporates all the templates, other features will be unlocked. Once this stage is released, the community will push marketing with a public beta in place.\u00a0  Think about it this way... Once the client is fully operational, pegging, staking, and any appropriate updates will be automatic - hence no reason for complexities of basic QT wallets where existing users bitch because they want to keep their old version running. The client will keep everyone on the same version automatically. Many things to come! I'd say now is a great time to accumulate on whoever continues to sell at this current price Cheers!"

        "Yeah this next update is major. I'm working on all templates. To give an idea how intense it is, ive attached screen shots. Bartering for example has 2 lists of items. A wish list of things you want and a list of things you have. People can trade their list with yours and Halo calculates the values of everything. So it will be extremely easy to find out how much Gold to send in exchange for potatoes and avocados. You can even combine goods and services BitBay is only used to insure the transactions so its critical to find out what the deposit has to be. Currently, it depends on: How big each shipment is, how much quantity you can sell and how many things in your list you will accept in exchange. Shipping is another matter entirely. I'm relying mostly on DHL because its in every country. This will be only for calculating shipping. Buyers will be able to calculate this (if i can find a good api). Sellers might have free shipping, request buyer to calculate or request the negotiate that only when in escrow. The three templates for offers are mostly done but countering is an entirely different ui in some cases (like in barter). Also the interface while in escrow in also different. So my estimate for time to spend coding on this, didnt consider some of the complexities of the templates themselves. Anyways, im making progress and hope to be done soon. Screenshots: Forms can be complex or simple depending on what is selected which reveals hidden sections. Same form with less selected... With cash deals, you need to supply funding info... but this info in withheld until the deal funds Standard employment contract. The unique feature here is automated payments with submission of progress reports. A Standard Sellers contract... its been recommended most people will want to debate shipping while in escrow, not before Wanna see something cool?! How about a reverse auction!? This can attract traffic to the market. The most INTENSE contract... bartering. Very complex for me to code this. We can figure out how much gold is worth an avocado. Goods/Services can be matched. The only thing is, since both parties ship things, there is no real way to calculate shipping, its assumed to be part of the price for now or it gets sorted out in escrow. Adding an item might be more advanced or not depending on the item. My idea is to encourage farm co-ops. The software magically knows what everything is worth and barters the items. You make your offer to the seller on this screen. Anyways, let me know your feedback, the shipping is by far the most complex issue. On slack we discussed giving the option to sort it out in escrow. But ive listed a few other options as well."

        "Personally I dont know why VC overlooked Halo. I've had working smart contracts for over a year. Its funny because they would reach out to me and call all the time and talk about how they can cut big checks and then they would just disappear. (Did they expect me to chase them? I'm busy actually working instead of kowtowing to VC) BitBay did raise funds, but i didnt see much of it(only about 200 btc) because it wasn't my project to begin with(although they slapped my name on it to raise funds even when I asked them not to). Out of the 5 people involved, 4 are gone and took their share of the ico(200 each) which didnt even raise what they said it did except for the 500 extra that Bob kept which he got under the table from BTER. Personally they did nothing to earn the funds, and they should have contributed towards advertising and dev. They all promised to give back to dev and didnt. It shocks me that out of 4 people nobody had the decency to honor their word. Although I have personally given back some to dev but have been unsuccessful in finding a dev capable of understanding the Halo source code. Its just too complex. So my attempt at hiring was a waste of BTC. So instead i do 100% of the dev work which is fine it just sort of sucks. In some ways it work faster this way. As for VCs, well I think they are stupid for not investing. And now I personally don't want VC because I've talked to my colleagues about it and we think it will be a \"Golden Cage\" where they will force me to make money back for them and I could be stuck doing this for years and it will limit the things I can do to contribute. But I'm still open to discussion on it. Also, how you said \"its for businesses with business plans and teams\". Halo does have a team, its just small. I've got a few people who volunteer on marketing and web and pr. I also wrote a 30 page business prospectus and executive summary and if you notice there is almost 30 pages of documentation that comes with the software. The VCs that I did speak to were too intimidated by the software because it \"is too useful/functional/too many features\" and apparently they need a product that has only one feature because they are stupid and cant wrap their minds around products that actually exist. I guess they havent heard of \"Adobe Photoshop\" before. Its easier to sell vaporware aparrently and Ive never been the kind of guy to look for handouts."

For those who arent on slack, we just made a new website(thats Meta and slack) and Im able to invest in that. Steven chipped in as well. Also we put the OP bounty to an infographic artist which will be useful and I'm still able to set some aside for other small marketing things once we finish everything. The templates are coming along great. The selling and buying of coins will have a fiat price tracker. Buying and selling commodities will have regular and reverse auctions, there is python programmable contracts so you guys can make your own smart contracts. And finally there is a bartering system that can calculate pounds, kilograms and see what they are worth for in hours and commodities etc. So I'm looking forward to volunteers testing those out when they are done. It will have shipping forms and all the fiat funding forms as well and the escrow window will be more functional. Finally the reputation system will be more mature and you should be able to check the escrow history of anyone on the blockchain. Once all that finishes I really think the project will be in a very marketable and commercial phase."

        "OB has no way of preventing theft. They are trying to use traditional escrow meaning escrow agents can easily take the bitcoins for themselves. That simply does not work on an anonymous platform. Also in reply to the post above, im not the one in control of this thread one of our slack members is. It seems like only one post was deleted and it was in regards to Bob so i can see how the mistake was made. The whole purpose of two person escrow is to eliminate theft and deception from trade. The is no other way to send worldwide wires with a stranger and trust the deal will complete honestly. Furthermore, it reduces the cost of doing business because you don't have to pay an escrow agent to babysit the deal wasting his time listening to \"he said she said\" stories or complaints being forced to arbitrate and guess who is lying(which is impossible anyways).No matter what any other company does, I will always insist they do what is right and abandon centralized expensive and deception prone old escrow models. This includes OB. Personally I hope they copy the Halo escrow model instead of stubbornly insisting on an old and model that history has proven time and time again to cost society trillions. If Mt. Gox had two of two multisig they would have never lost the .5 billion. If sheep marketplace had two party escrow they would have never lost 200 million dollars. Read that again, almost 1 billion dollars. Almost 30% of Bitcoin was taken by a handful of thieves. So much for decentralized. If OB uses escrow agents it will happen again. Also, those agents will have absolutely no way of figuring out who is telling the truth in shipping disputes (use E-Bay empty box scams as a perfect example). If ebay had two party escrow they would never have to deal with theft accusations, paypal reversals and shipping disputes. People would stop scamming people with shipments. If farming co-ops had two party escrow they could trade without fiat or coins. They could purely trade commodities. Pure barter. If telcom or any other industry that depended on wires had two party escrow they would save billions, and not have to stress over \"which bank to choose, which escrow to use\". Instead, Nigera could do deals with Greece regardless of the low trust level for their banking systems. Immediately trade is possible worldwide without any reason to trust. Shippments would no longer be lost, and they would not have to wait YEARS for insurance payouts. In fact, that happened to a friend of mine who had 100,000 dollars in medical equipment stolen and he has been in lawsuits for almost a decade. Two party escrow dramatically reduces lawsuits because nobody profits off of the theft or loss. The only thing that matters is that this idea gets popular in society. Even though its not popular yet, that must change to end theft and deception from business deals."

        "That was posted at r/BitBay already. The news covered it and its in the chat logs. I got 191 BTC for Halo where 20 was deferred into a 100 btc dev fund. Bob and Gekko stole half of that by convincing Steven to pay a nonsense bill. Thus only 50 was left in that(they promised 500 but of course that never happened). At the end of the project, Steven released that fund to me and raised it to about 60(20 which was mine anyways). It was a multisig, but he gave me the second key eventually since he felt it was more secure that way. The multisig address was common knowledge the news covered this and it was posted on reddit. The blockchain is easy to follow so I'm not sure what you mean by documents. Considering how it has been spent, there was developers in Cambodia which didn't work out, I've also paid one dev for a refactor which didn't work out. There has been many little things. So far, I've had to do all the developement and management. None of that was supposed to be my responsibility. Lastly, on slack we have run several bounties there was at least 10 BTC in costs for the new qt wallets, servers, bounties etc. Another 5 BTC for the new site and the OP I'm also paying some towards which slack is also contributing. Mostly, I didn't always pay from the multisig account because Steven was hard to get a hold of. So in answer to your question, I've been paying out of pocket for a while and those addresses including all my personal ones were already shown. Its not like any of the original people who were supposed to run the project are here anymore. None of those things were supposed to be my responsibility in the first place. Not to mention any fiat expenses which really come out of pocket. The way I was hired was only to license Halo. Consider that I'm taking on responsibilities that were never supposed to be mine in the first place. I was supposed to be cloning Halo and project managing only and now I'm doing many more things."

        "Are you fudding this project or something? I spent way more than 15, there was hiring devs which amounted to at least 7,000 usd. I had 4 Cambodian devs who were not able to contribute much to the code unfortunately and one guy who attempted a refactor but failed because it was too complex for him. The dev fund was only 60, 20 of which was my cut. The 171 was paid to me for my dev work on the project. Which personally is not worth the abuse. So at least 45 btc was spent over the past 8 months. As I told you I'm not even considering flights, expenses or anything else business related that ive paid out of pocket. I'm actually doing dev work and the Halo software is worth millions. 100 btc was the original offer for my license alone not even considering all the overtime on my dev work. The dev fund was to help development and I'm working 80 hour work weeks, and I'm not abandoning the project. I'm sure once i finish calculating my hourly wage it will be less than if i had been working at McDonalds. This project was started by other people. If you concern is lack of finances, then go hunt down Bob/Ryan who have 1000 BTC combined and did absolutely nothing except fud their own project. Not to mention bter who also has hardly contributed anything and they also got 191 BTC. When they left if I wasnt here, then nobody would even be running this thing. My goal is to finish the software as promised. If you are sincerely interested in the software then stop distracting me, be more positive and get on slack."

        "mrcashking, lets get some things straight here: Bitbay was not my coin to begin with, it was Steven Dais. He offered me 100 + 10% of the coin which i never would have taken this deal otherwise because I was working in Blackcoin for FREE i might add for one year. That got raised later a few days before the ico. You and the investors did not only get a clone of BlackHalo, you also got my undivided time and attention to complete the tasks which were promised. The agreement made to Steven who hired me was exactly this: To build decentralized markets and implement a pegging/hedging system. Two reasons were made for the decision of pegging. One, was because i wanted to permanently protect investors from volatility in existing coins and because i didnt know if i could trust Stevens partners. Let me make some more points. Steven paid me a good amount of that Bitcoin in advance. If he had not hired me i would never have cared to work on a pegging system or on decentralized markets. By the way, I've delivered decentralized markets FASTER than an entire team of people working at Open Bazaar. Let that sink in for a minute. You think its so fucking easy then pick up a computer and start coding it yourself. See if you can make decentralized markets in 2 months flat with a full counter-offer system. You didnt hire me, that 171 BTC was not for developement. The funds raised from the ICO namely the amounts that Steven, Lin, Bob and Gekko got were supposed to be used for developement. They got over 1300 BTC. If you are really upset about it go chase them who have done NOTHING. Bob promised 500 in the dev fund to start with. Instead every single one of them kept the btc and left. This includes Bob/Lin and Ryan. Also, I have spent money on development as listed before and i took my time to explain to you how it was spent and what the results were. In exchange for the Bitcoin, Bitbay will have exactly what was promised. You aleady have markets, im working on templates, if I'm not coding there is no client and nobody else in Bitcoin even knows how to do it... I've tried to hire coders they dont exist. And the ones that do charge several hundred thousand a year. So I'm the only one who can even code this. Its not really even that much money and I'm going to be stuck working the rest of the year. Personally this is not worth the aggravation. How would you like it if i went to your job and told you that you shouldnt be receiving money for your work? Now dont be surprised if these comments get deleted, Meta wants the forums to be positive and supportive. Finally, the code I made in Blackcoin was not open source, people would make me offers of 30-50,000 for the code all the time. But since they wanted dark markets i turned them down. BitBay was the first to ask for it and want commercial markets. The code is worth millions, not just a few scraps of BTC. Entire companies are working on this and cant even produce smart contracts. In fact, the Bitcoin foundation failed for 4 years to produce working smart contracts until BlackHalo was made. You just dont know what you are talking about. BE patient, go find something else to do while you wait. Pegging is extremely complex coding and the templates added over 10,000 lines of code to the core. If there is a single typo or mistake in logic, the code wont work. Most of my day is spent figuring out how to make the code secure from ddos, changing of the code, hacks and other attempts to interfere with contracts. This includes filtering and checking every piece of the contracts communication. And thats not the half of it."

The situation in crypto now is that good news and great features usually don't affect the price. Pegging and real trades, working market \u0097 that is what we need. I have an idea: let's organize the \"club of buyers\". All of you can think of what you are willing to buy. Then we can not only publish such wishes on bitbay itself (hope templates allow to do it), but also send letters to alibaba sellers (and any other sellers) saying that we are ready to buy their products, maybe buy many, but using only bitbay. We can cooperate and organize groups, for example, group of musicians to buy musical instruments and equipment. I think some sellers will use bitbay, even if it's a little tricky concerning price of bays, if they understand that they can sell three guitars and a lot of other stuff at once."

Its a question of how much liquidity is desired. We can roll the peg upwards using deflation (and that may also create a nice arbitrage too). The key here is supply should match demand. So the thing is, every update comes in order. We have the templates working nicely so when people see the peg and buy in, they see the user friendly markets that even their mom could understand which we could fill with p2p cash orders or selling items etc. New buyers will see the value in completed software. Plus it makes marketing it so much easier! That is why this update comes first. As for an update on progress, yes the software is coming along. I'm currently privately testing the fiat templates which also have automatic price tracking. Also testing guarantor contracts for people without deposits. This new client is totally different the entire UI for contracts has transformed. Its perhaps my biggest update to the contracting system itself in a year. So consider that this update is huge. I've got to make sure its watertight, stable, fast and secure. So\u00a0 be patient, things are progressing and we will have something soon."

It's completely flexible. Heck you could create a contract where you deposit 0 and yet require the buyer to deposit 12,000 - you are in charge! You might not get any interested buyers, but that's your problem. But then again, maybe you have a very high reputation system, and a buyer will trust you to your unbalanced terms.

The deposits will be automatically set for her and she will notice that she needs extra coins to start the offer. However if she doesnt have the deposit, she can set a custom one. If you sell a 6000 dollar item, there is no reason a 1000 dollar deposit is not enough. After all the person will rather release escrow and get their 1000 back than pay 7k for something that was 6k. Also you can do guarantor contracts where the deposit is zero. But perhaps only one person deposits. So mom wants to buy her first coin, she doesnt have funds. So she asks for a guarantor(the software figures that out automatically) and a person can put up their deposit so mom can trust them but she is not required to do one. A guarantor would probably only sell about 50-100 dollars worth of coins to her in that case. But they will deposit 50 on a contract of 50 and all mom would have to do is sign for it after she sends the cash."

        "Hi all, strange as it sounds I just discovered Bitbay a few days ago, lol.....which is good for me because a. the price is great right now and b. it looks like things are about to roll out!! 3. questions for David, if I may: 1. I understand the concept of writing code into each bitbay wallet that would freeze a given percentage of coins in that wallet, thus lowering the available supply and thus raising the price. However, what do you do about Bittrex? I'm sure there are tens of millions of coins on Bittrex so how would you deal with that? Do you somehow freeze a percentage of coins in Bittrex's wallets? Do you first require that all coins be removed from Bittrex and THEN freeze them? This is the one thing that really confuses me about the peg. 2. Do you still have large sellers from Alibaba and other large corporations waiting to jump on board when bitbay is up and ready? 3. I know it gets annoying when investors are constantly asking for updates, but I'm wondering if you have a vague timeline for the completed bitbay as well as the peg?  Thanks SO much.......glad I found this coin!!!"

        "Yeah sure! Some of these have already been answered but not sure we have a faq for that yet. The first question is a great one and it works like so: Once I complete the fork, the exchange will get an updated version of the wallet. Whenever someone trades they will report that trade to the api which will simulate it and figure out how much is reserve and liquid. The exchange will most likely have a special version of the client for this. They will report 2 balances in the exchange, Bitbay and BitBay reserve. However we will make it easy for them. Exchanges already need to run the coin daemons for actual withdraws so asking the api for that info should be trivial. IF they oversell the coin, that would be no different from selling phantom bitcoin or phantom dogecoin Its extremely unethical for the exchange to do that! Although they have been know to do that since there is no regulation. If they try that in BitBay the will immediately be found out though because the miners will decline the withdraw! Because you cant take more money than is liquid! There is no way to cheat that. Okay so your second question. I'm still in contact with the guy who started the project although he is a little inactive. Perhaps hes just waiting for me to update. He used to work at Alibaba and should have some contacts. Lastly, the next update so far is one of the most major core updates which is total redesign of the UI for contracts and templates which automatically track prices and negotiate. Not to mention tons of other little changes. We should at least be testing several of the templates this month. Once thats done, the next step is pegging."

This is very relevant to BitBay because we are creating an excellent and safe alternative to eBay. The article shows how ebay is using its position to block the upcoming of crypto payments in general. For the article check this link:  -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The upcoming Client update will incorporate Google Translate, meaning that 92 different languages will be available at the click of a button. This will make our client accessible and user friendly to non-english speakers, majorly increasing the potential reach of our solution. Of course, english speakers that prefer their mother tongue will also benefit! -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We are finishing up a brand new website for BitBay, yes you read it right! This site brings together a wealth of information about BitBay, as well as many other interesting features. One of these is a fully custom forum for BitBay, which we hope will become the community hub and where you all can receive support and have all kinds of conversations! -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our Bitcointalk OP is getting a nice overhaul as well, which will be replacing the current OP. We are busy playing with options for graphics and expect to have this ready within a week, our thanks go to Crz for taking the time! -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And last but not least David is working hard on the advanced BitBay client, fixing it up and adding more features and templates. This is indeed a huge task but we are seeing daily progress and things are really shaping up. If you feel like you want to keep in touch on a daily basis, feel free to join our slack group. You can get an invite by sending an short message to   saying you\u0092d like to join. Thank you for reading and we wish you a nice weekend!"

        "The branding of Bitbay is more conducive to markets. There are also features exclusive to BitBay such as the pegging/hedging tools. The issue with BitHalo and\u00a0 BlackHalo is that it will be harder to guarantee a stable price growth or stable economy. So yes, pegging is the only feature that is exclusively BitBay in our immediate roadmap. However, consider its much easier to use markets when the prices aren't all over the place. Especially if there is a price growth with a rolling peg. Blackcoin is the first coin I developed in however im not the main dev so there is less control over protocol. Decentralized markets are not technically hard coded in the coins protocol. It uses Bitmessage and the Halo modifications that are fully decentralized. However, Blackcoin will be the base currency for NightTrader microtrading contracts. So they have their own advantages. My primary interest is delivering the products exactly as promised. Personally, i don't have a preference of Bitcoin over Blackoin or Bitbay. They are all good coins. The thing about pegging is, its a hard coded protocol so it will work without exchanges or with them. But we do need to make sure that exchanges are willing to put the new Bitbay on their exchange. If everything works out well, then I'm very bullish on Bitbay(of course). So yeah Blackcoin and Bay are my primary interests as coins because the people who invested in those want to see it pay off. My interest in Halo is totally separate. It's not a financial incentive. I don't care if Halo succeeds, I care that double deposit escrow (2 party escrow) becomes the standard in Bitcoin. Nobody should use 3rd parties, it goes completely against decentralization. Third parties are biased. So yeah the Halo stuff is more of an idealistic thing. Its the reason i came to Bitcoin. As for Halo licenses, whats the point of a license if the idea of DECENTRALIZATION dies with it?? We want 2 party escrow, no courts or complex paperwork, no arbiters who are biased, no middle men taking from every deal, no more theft and deception. That idea i hope will become the standard escrow even if another company copies it and Halos name is forgotten. Pegging happens to be one of my favorite cryptocurrency concepts. I really think programmable money should not be limited to the boring \"Bob sends Alice coins\". If we can force the coins to behave like an actual economy then we can prove cryptocurrency has true advantages over the dollar. We can make coins act like different asset classes, use the blockchain as a notary, and even use it to represent time. Bitcoin is not being used correctly. Its being used as a speculative asset. Thats what we are trying to change."

The difference here at Bay is the proposal is to cause supply to react to voting so the peg can roll and grow the price or it could be a hard peg. Since all value is determined by supply vs demand i think its probably the simplest way to do a peg (either a hard peg or a rolling one). Still i read bitshares paper and i think they do pretty good work over there. Ethereum has been proposed almost a year ago with very little activity. If they ever exist, they will need to hurry up and finish so people can develop for it. I'm not sure that\u00a0 blockchain based approach is the correct one. Not everything should be on the blockchain especially applications. On the other hand (some) modifications to the scripting system would be extremely useful so that is where i see Etheriums proposal a good idea. After all the bitcoin stack language is way too limiting."

Even when you offer to pay them, regardless of how much is offered, most coders are not able to work on crypto stuff and most of them are extremely slow or are dishonest about their hours or need to spend weeks just understanding the code. The bigger problem is most of them will take weeks to respond and then disappear. So yeah, every time im just forced to do all the coding. But honestly, its faster this way since i know the code by heart and can quickly debug it. But of course i do wish there was someone out there who could help. I think the coders that are, cost hundreds of thousands per year. And even then, there is no guarantee they will be motivated to work hard every day. In that case, you need a good project manager too. When you think about it though being the only coder has its advantages. I don't have to spend all day training people or be at their mercy. And i can make many more commits and even break the code up if i want. Considering that Halo was the first with smart contracts and markets, i think we have done things a lot faster doing things this way."

Right now 1 btc can get you over a MILLION Bitbays! Now what are the chances that in a few months your 1M Bays will be worth 1M dollars? Well I don't really know, but considering that the dev is a bonafide genius and considering he and a team of others have been working on this project for nearly a year, I can definitely say that the chance of the peg working is WAY WAY WAY better than the chance of you winning a scratch off ticket for any substantial amount of money. Bottom line is that anyone that doesn't put at least 1 btc into Bay right now is just a fool. The ratio of risk to reward here is about as good as you will ever see in your lifetime."

        "Yes pegging will start very low I expect. $0.01 to start with possible even less maybe!? Over time will hopefully slowly increase as demand rises. The more people that own Bitbay & use it in the markets the better. So it's in everyone's interest to have the price pegged at a sensible price to allow newcomers & give them the opportunity to buy into Biybay & experience the markets.  Of cause pegging happens after the markets are released. Let's not rush David too much! He had a lot on his plate currently lol.  Slow and steady wins the race!"

        "^ the pegging has been discussed in depth about how much liquidity we should have. I feel like volume is going to be more important than price in the end. I would rather see it where it takes 1 year to sell 1 million bay at .01 cents than it would be 5-10 years to sell 1 million at $1. But really thats up to the core community. I know munti is well versed on the subject. It would be nice to run some simulations to get an idea of the ideal rate of growth. And of course marketing will always be important too, because having a product is half the battle. But then again, if volume is high that would reflect demand and if it sustains high volume we could always test higher levels by voting. As for ETA, the templates was a much bigger update than anticipated. Not to mention ive created a translator that supports 92 languages. That forced me to update the strings to utf16 which was a little bit of a pain. Also, ive made tons of changes to the core and made it a lot more efficient. We are going to be testing a build with the first template this week. After the first template is tested and we confirm price tracking of the usd works, guarantor contracts and all the user friendly stuff works, the others will be easier and faster for sure. Pegging gets worked on after that. After all, its best to have the product completely commercial. In other words, the point is, this inflation/deflation freezing/unfreezing tool is probably my favorite idea in crypto. So yeah of course its worth working my ass off to get it completed regardless of anything else. After all, actions speak louder than words."

Some view the scandal as a shame and some see it as an opportunity to buy more cheap. If you are looking to get your 4BTC back, why not PM boobsurplus and his pet cryptogekkko.

Yet now that they stole the funds and abandoned the coin - here we are! If you didn't sell your 4BTC worth of ICO bitbays, then you aren't out at all yet. Just have a little patience on what's to come here very soon! edit: and now David, is the lead dev for the coin since the riff raff is out! Granting him rights to interlink his Halo technology into a coin system so as to allow him to control protocol build - for once! This is a diamond in the rough!"

There is no other truly decentralized marketplace out there at this stage in development that promises peg technology. Just image this price and imagine the peg at at least 1 cent. That's a good investment. The best part is knowing that after the peg is initiated... others can't just dump all their coins. You will have a reserve to liquid ratio or frozen to unfrozen accounts. So your investment is protected! \u00a0Yet your reserve or frozen coins will still be tradeable in a 'futures market'! Meaning that if you need some cash quick, you could sell your liquid coins and still sell your reserve coins yet those coins won't flood the market and therefore can't directly affect the current liquid value!

These templates will be released one by one exclusively to the bitbay slack community to beta test.  \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Once all templates are tested, we will market a public beta update for the bitbay client with all the new features! - \u00a0 P2P reputation system for the marketplace! - \u00a0 UTF-16 keyboard conversion - or in other words, support for foreign language contracts! - \u00a0 Our new website is almost ready for release, we are testing for bugs and preparing our forum - \u00a0 One of our member on slack is in alpha stage with his crypto-coin exchange and has begun the process of utilizing Halo\u0092s multi-sig technology for BitBay!  \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0This will be the first of its kind! We will utilize this exchange as a beta for implementing Bitbay\u0092s peg technology system so other exchanges can follow  \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0suit once the peg is at final release to minimize any potential bugs! \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0https://sweedx.com - \u00a0 Anoxy, the creator of Sweedx.com is open for any and all suggestions during this alpha and beta process! - Thanks to, J-bar, a member on Slack, for finding a simple solution to allow for both the qt wallet and the client to run at the same time!  \u00a0\u00a0Meaning you can stake in your qt wallet, while you are experimenting with the client beta program! \u00a0\u00a0To allow for both wallets to be open at the same time, please follow these steps: \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 1 - As always, make a backup of your wallet! \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 2 - Find your bitbay qt executable file in your computer. Right click on it & create a shortcut icon.  \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 3 - Right click on the shortcut icon and click on 'Properties'.  \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 4 - In this menu click on the 'Shortcut' tab and then add \u00a0 \u00a0\"-port=8334\" \u00a0 at the end of the script in the 'Target' field  \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 So for example your new Target script should show something similar to \u00a0\"C:\\Users\\John Doe\\Desktop\\bitbay-qt.exe\" -port=8334 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 5 - Congratulations! Now you can load up the qt wallet through this shortcut icon and also have your client running as well! - \u00a0 Many people are joining us on Slack. It is the right place to stay tuned to any news and of course to meet people with the same interests! - \u00a0 You can send an E-mail to   for an invite!

With the new templates orders will be able to stay longer on the markets (considering you remain connected) and you can track prices for fiat. This should encourage the markets in the client to populate. I'm sure price wise people are only waiting for the news. Then others are waiting for pegging so they wont buy back in until later. So you know guys just hang tight, be patient we've got a lot of great updates prepared. Also it should be noted that I'm trying to make larger updates instead of multiple small ones. This new update you will want to uninstall the markets client(not qt, that you can keep as is) and do a fresh install of the new markets client. The new one has an autoupdate link. Large updates are better because im starting to make the software more commercial and i don't want people complaining about missing features.

The rewards will probably be higher because there is less people staking. So its a huge bonus for people who have less coins, they will get a higher probability of finding blocks i think. When i was testing the multisig staking i was shocked by how many blocks i was finding. Its one feature im very eager to get done. And its good to be wary.

To achieve this, we need to have a startdate (so we can calcuate an enddate). Since on the enddate your compound interest would be paid. Having said that. I bought a 20 million bitbay a few months ago. (march/april). However when I tried to sent Bay from 1 wallet address to another address\u00a0 (guess it would make more sence to hold everything in 1 address then 2). I got an error. By using coin control I was able to sent all mini transactions (over 2500) to my main address). Situation  Address 1 3M  Address 2 2M  Combined\u00a0 5M So again, which date is used for the compound interest of the complete wallet Buy date of 20M Or Buy date 3M Last week (when I transferred it) 2M"

Currently the qt is hosted by another github dev. Anyways, its a fork of blackcoin staking at 1%. Although it seems like people are reporting getting more than that because there isn't enough people staking so now would be a good time to connect for that little bonus.

Also an improved pay to email system. In order to install it, i would recommend uninstalling your old build. You should obviously back up your two keys if you havent already.

Which coin do you favour blackcoin or bitbay? i have both but will go in further on the one you see as gaining more of your attention in the future.

        "Hey there, yeah this is a really good question and I am glad you have asked it. The first question being primarily about BitHalo. First of all, as everyone knows, I don't market BitHalo. The only reason we ended up having articles on BitHalo was because many reporters don't want to do stories on altcoins and I do expect that to change one day. BitHalo may be the door that gets people interested in Blackcoin and Bitbay so we should not shut it! And thats why I still have an interest in it. However, coding/community/etc I dedicate my full time in BlackHalo and BitBay. Its all still powered by Halo though which is really your question. So... Because of Halo core, they are similar products. Halos design was meant to be coin agnostic. To prove that we don't need fancy Etherium code hard coded into the blockchain interfering with decentralization and a coins ability to scale(bandwidth/bloat). This is exactly why I've proposed features that are exclusive to BitBay and Blackcoin. There are two things that make BitBay unique. The first being its branding. People use \"E-Bay\" because because it is branded in a way that people think of markets when they do. BitBay has the name that I think will make people think of markets and economy. And NightTrader has a name that obviously make people think of trading/exchange. As you pointed out, pegging is the exclusive feature. However, pegging is the feature that I'm the most bullish on because of the fact that if you are selling something in the markets and it's low volume you don't want prices to decline in the middle of your transaction. And even if they do, you would want long term price growth. Also, the fact that there is two different asset classes (frozen/liquid) really opens tons of doors (lending against frozen assets, large swaps, etc). Even on discussions on slack we have yet to break the ice on how much can be done there. Blackcoin will be the base currency for any exchanges on NightTrader and again is branded. They don't have the rigid peg system and thus appeals more to speculation (which is not really a bad thing). They can and might go in a more anonymous direction as they just released stealth addresses. Plus Blackcoin is a place where many coders look to fork proof of stake security which is rat4s territory. So I have more control over BitBay and its protocol. In theory, I was hired to only be a project manager and now have had to completely take over the project to protect it. And I do hold enough BitBay to make it worth my while to see this one to the end. So I have more control here but I really don't have a favorite because I want both communities to prosper. In the end, I'm very bullish on pegging if it works out the way we plan. However NightTrader could prove to be popular. Right now I see people still throwing money at centralized exchanges unfortunately so I don't know we have to wait and see. As for open source well that will happen when the time is right. It has to happen one day, but it certainly will not happen until I have a completed project and i will probably wait to see that things are in fact successful. When people fork an idea the original usually remains more popular anyways we can't count on being the only game in town forever. For when I leave crypto thats more of a personal decision. To be honest, i really don't like coding alone, and programming is not great for my health. So i'm looking forward to completion. If this turns out to be profitable and it doesn't upset the forces that be too much, and I can find some coders then I will probably still have a hand in the project. Not to mention if it succeeds we may get interesting offers."

I have a bit of both but always looking to grab more of each when good opportunities arise. The time and effort that goes into coding such things as the pegging is beyond most peoples comprehension. I hope we keep it closed long enough to gain the fair rewards such coding deserves. I'm pleased to hear the pegging is exclusive to bitbay."

        "Sweet! I got confirmation that my new Western Union prepaid card is in the mail and should be delivered soon. Can't wait to try it out! For those interested. Bitbay has multiple features for sending payments and receiving payments. These features will be evolving! What I love with Western Union's prepaid card, for the time being, is that it minimizes tx fees for Bay to fiat transactions! It has a max of 5 dollars for USA domestic transactions and a minimum of 99 cents. Foreign transactions are of course higher, but it's WAY better than using a credit card to create a transaction through western union to an international agency for manual pickup. So this way if you are a lazy 'couch potato' that want's to minimize fees, you don't even have to leave your house to go to an agency and retrieve your money. You can receive payments or send payments directly from the card and that means everything is online!!! Check it out!"

I should mention, if a lot of time goes by, and we find that we have to open source, eventually people will want to audit the code and when that happens I can't promise this will not get forked. However, right now its my priority to make sure the people who are still following this project get what they came for and obviously that means we will want to keep our advantage in the market for as long as possible. Not to mention, if i release source too early, it will get used for the wrong reasons."

        "This week we got another round of nice updates! -The new BCT OP has been updated! It\u0092s quite an eye opener! And has all new updated links for client wallet downloads! - The Windows OS, \u0093Sell Coin\u0094 template has been updated into the Client to all Slack members and BCT members for testing. This gives the client a total of 2 templates to test including the existing \"Custom Contract\" template. To download: \u00a0You can either ask to join our slack group by PM to David, Munti, or emailing  Or go to the links provided in our official websites: bitbaymarket.net OP here on BCT  - And yes, you read that right! Our new official website, Bitbay.market is live!! It has a built-in forum! We\u0092ve been very busy lately testing the client, yet the new website and forum will continue to evolve and will be a great hub for Client related information, updates, technical help, and community adoption. Thanks Meta and Munti for all the hard work setting it up! - If you have previously downloaded the Client. Follow these steps to install the new client: As always back up your private keys. If you have any existing contracts on the marketplace, backup your contract.dat files. The beauty of Bitbay is that it has a built-in, auto-backup system for contracts! Delete the existing Bitbay Client Install new Client from links provided above. Remember the Client will need to \u0091sync\u0092 to the entire blockchain. This can currently take anywhere from 5-10 hours. For the sake of security, you must wait for the blockchain to syncronize 100% before the Client will allow you to begin doing transactions. Bootstraps are in progress and will be ever-evolving to download: See OP for existing link! In the future, most updates will just require downloading on top of the existing Client version and will not require downloading/resync of blockchain! -The world\u0092s first international Bitbay \u0091Sell Coins for Cash\u0092 transaction has been finalized. Thanks to slack member \u0091ptcgroup10009\u0091! The Client gave him the ability to create a \u0091Sell Coins\u0092 contract on the Bitbay marketplace and a buyer sent him the necessary fiat via Western Union to finalize it! At the time he was vacationing in the Dominican Republic! Bitbay\u0092s fiat payment system already includes bank wire feeds, along with other methods of payment, and will continue to evolve! Thanks for reading, we wish you a nice weekend!"

        "Guys we need some community support here! The system is live! I don't think you really understand the power of this template released. Currently we have a sell coins template/app that basically has the ability to create a built-in bot for Bitbay. This will continue to evolve! The \"Buy Coins\" template/app is about to be released as well. Same setup but opposite construct.  Sure it's not as advance yet as Quatloo or Cryptocircuits! But damn it man! It's built into the Client with multisig technology backing it! This means that you can use Bitbay's 'Sell coin' feature (soon to include Buy Coin feature) to sell Bitbays with either a set price or with a price tracker that's automatically adjusting your contract prices! I'm saying this because I really don't think you guys really understand the gravity of this potential! This is the first wallet with a built-in bot with multi-sig technology backing it! Recently someone just sold his Bitbay's through the client so he could receive fiat. I bought his coins and he was paid through Western Union while he was on vacation! Yet think of the possibilities once the new Buy coins feature is released!! Imagine if you live in some 3rd world country that doesn't allow for you to transfer your fiat to crypto securely! With Buy Coins feature - now anywhere in the world that allows you to have a bank account or has Western Union or similar... you could simply send fiat to the coin seller on Bitbay and have those coins deposited in your wallet with these new templates! I'd hope you would do such a thing to buy Bitbay! But if you just wanted to securely transfer fiat for crypto. You could use this service, then sell your Bays on any exchange so you could buy what ever coin of your liking! Point is, now you have an easy, secure, trustless way to do it!!! No more waiting!! No more thoughts of..., \"Well if I only had Coinbase, or xyz company come to my country, then I'd finally get into crypto!\" Bitbay can already bypass them! After all, isn't that what Satoshi wanted all along - no more middlemen! True Crypto-currencies should be about removing the middleman in any way, shape, or form!! The sky is the limit! Take your markets back! Take your money back! See above for latest windows client downloads"

And the remaining ones will follow shortly. But at least now, we have a decentralized p2p exchange for fiat which ends up being cheaper or equal to coinbase with a much larger potential reach."

        "This is a really brilliant use case for two party escrow! Good idea. Thats great that you know Rife, very few people knew who he was. And he is like probably one of the most brilliant minds to disappear. There was similar concepts like the one by Kanzius who was injecting cancer with metals and using microwaves. He was able to light water on fire using special frequencies. And im trying to remember the guy who did some unbelievable things with metals and objects using frequencies. This was like in the very corner of the internet... the dude was causing objects to do some insane things. Then there is other \"claims\" of frequencies being used for things like Coral Castle which I've seen in person twice but those are much harder to verify. The book on Rife I actually own and have read a lot of it they say that the problem was to harm the industry fake devices started flooding the market and FDA had to \"ban\" resonance frequency. Of course like all things, this just is so familiar. I've also been to the Zeiss microscopy at Heidelburg where they said Rife got his honorary Phd and watched they microscope and compared it to what Rife was doing. And you know what? Rife was literally 100s of times better than anything we have even today. So one reason his work is so hard to replicate is because nobody has access to microscopes and labs of the quality his was! Nonetheless, people are trying to replicate his work. Heidelburg now has a new program with a similar theory for making specific drug cocktails for the person instead of using broad spectrum drugs which are obviously useless. This new idea of drugs made specific to the person shares an idea with Rife but of course its not as good. I heard there was preliminary success and of course it will never hit the market. My belief/dream is that 3d printing is one of the worlds most important technologies because once you cant print electronics from home they can be open sourced and we will finally know once and for all what can and cannot be done. I'm not sure it will ever get as advanced as complex crystals and microscopes and frequency devices but you never know."

        "Rifes microscopes we so much more than anything we have today because he could look at bacteria without killing it. In fact his microscope is known to be one of the most powerful in the world. But it wasnt the power it was the method he used to isolate color frequencies that would not kill the bacteria allowing him to observe it and thus he said that bacteria is pleomorphic which was extremely controversial for saying and he eventually lost to modern dogma, propaganda, court cases and sabotage from many angles. Now today people are aware of pleomorphism but nowhere on Rifes level because he is gone. The medicine im talking about at Heidelburg is not homeopathic. It is manufacturing the drug specifically for what you have by taking a sample of the illness for example and making the drug cocktail that will only kill that strain of illness. So I'm not a fan of drugs but its supposedly 100% cure rate but (supposedly) it can put the body into shock with too many dead cells to clear too fast so people can die(which didnt make sense to me but its not my field of expertise). I'm not sure if they have started testing on people yet or still on rats would have to ask my friend."

        "Halo has been closed source for a year and a half since its inception in BitHalo. To be honest, crypto people don't usually build from source either. Its a false sense of security you have there. Tell me, do you check the source code of every coin you run? Of course not. The reason its closed is so people don't use the tech to run pump and dumps and so they don't try to exploit decentralized markets and to keep a competitive advantage. Originally, i wanted to open source and got tons of pms and emails mostly on blackcoin subreddit telling me not to. I have worked on this source code for 1.5 years alone. I'm not going to just post my code until I'm ready. I've carefully analyzed most of the popular githubs and realized there is not enough commits to justify it. I'm predicting if i did post on github, that almost nobody would contribute. Bitcoin is still stuck in the stone ages with hardly any changes and people fight about block size? Seriously? If they cant get past such a trivial thing there is no way in hell Bitcoin will make mainstream. By the time they finish their stupid blocksize debate, devs 10 times more talented than any of us working for a bank will probably code a better bitcoin from scratch and release for big banks or companies. Also, i explicitly said anyone can pm me for source code to build Halo with. All i do is change variable names with a customized obfuscator that makes the variables into funny Doge names. I'm not asking people in crypto to run distributables but we want double deposit to reach a wider audience and they certainly will not build from source. On that note 99% of the people buying crypto definitely do not build from source. They go to the website, they run the distributable which most definitely could be compromised. So if we took our security seriously, then we would all build from source after independently auditing it. I'm not hiding behind a fake profile, and have a reputation known outside of crypo. Add this to the fact that the majority of my day is spent on security, preventing hacks, keeping peoples coins secure, preventing double spend, making sure contracts can be sent bogus data, preventing spoofing on the markets etc."

        "You know what, i should add to my reply one thing. Everything should be decentralized and trustless. Decentralized media, open source electronics, 3d printing, aquaponics, etc etc etc. I relieves the burden of consumption from society. Crypto has to be more decentralized. Halo specifically is decentralized escrow (2 party escrow) as of course you know. The markets can really be used as decentralized servers in a sense because of the way bitmessage shares channel keys. So here we have decentralized markets, escrow, contracts, and currency. The pattern is simple. So I definitely want to eliminate myself from the equation. Notice how no escrow fee is charged! But there is a time and place for everything and the time to put source on github is not yet. sidhujag, i support your projects and respect your opinion! And hopefully soon everything will be finished.  The next update will be selling and buying anything with auctions and reverse auctions. For now i encourage people to use the p2p cash for coins contracts and regular custom contracts."

        "This week we are excited to announce another round of nice updates! - The Windows OS, \u0093Buy Coin\u0094 template has been updated into the Client for all Slack members and BCT members for testing. This completes the \u0093Buy/Sell Coins\u0094 feature in the \u00a0 \u00a0Clients \u0093Home\u0094 tab. This gives the client a total of 3 templates to test out; Buy Coins, Sell Coins, and Custom Contracts.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If you are new to Bitbay, please follow these instructions to download the Client: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, download and install the core version 1.2 which can be found in our official websites: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0bitbaymarket.net \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The OP on BCT  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, download the update file and install it - this will automatically update the \u00a0core download to the latest version 1.21 \u00a0Link: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If you already have the existing core version 1.2 installed, simply skip the first step above.  \u00a0- For new users, check out the get started section on Bitbay.market \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We recommend the following files to be backed up in multiple safe locations: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Both your private keys. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Contracts.dat file - this stores your existing contracts in the marketplace \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Other.dat file - this stores various important account and marketplace information, existing order numbers, and existing inbox email correspondence. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Outbox.dat file - stores existing outbox email correspondence.  - New users must be reminded that the Client will need to \u0091sync\u0092 to the entire blockchain.

How many other coins, with their Bitcoin based QT wallets, can create such a feature? Now that you understand how you can add a market or join a market, you can begin to see the real beauty behind all of this. Let's say you want to sell a painting, but want to have an exclusive buyers club 'for your eyes only' type deal. You could create an 'xyz painting for sale' market (or anything your imagination allows) and simply send your buyers club the name of the market so they could join it and see what paintings you are selling - no one else could see it because they'd have to join it as well - but in order for them to do that, they'd need the name of the market!

After that he will continue with buy/sell anything templates. We have done a lot of testing the last weeks, and so far we haven't found any major problems. Thank you David for doing such a solid job. While we wait for more templates there is other things that need to be done. Top of the list is marketing. Our site   has been up and running for some weeks now, and we have fixed a few details with the forum section. OP has had it's major overhaul, and now we have added some diagrams to it as well. There is still one in the making. We expect it to be done soon. Core team is working on a few marketing strategies, and we expect to implement the first one within two weeks.

I'm known outside of crypto, in multiple different fields, it would be nonsense for me to do anything that isnt honorable and consistent with my other professions. Besides, markets were delivered, a few templates delivered(more to come), fully new UI, all core features greatly improved. And all without other developer help(another promise by the two chinese partners, bter said they had \"devs\"). Otherwise, a supportive community remains and thanks to them it helps motivate me code.

As mentally warped as Bob is, he is probably not the craziest person i know. I've been stabbed in the back many times before. Some of those stories are equally as wild as this one. Its a lonely path having to turn my back a majority of people because im taking precaution since it becomes increasingly harder and harder to trust over time. These trustless solutions based on Bitcoin is a result of a unfortunate necessity in society. The most extreme of checks and balances, that the best scenario is to not trust at all. Ironically, i turned down several other offers before taking the Bitbay one. But then again, no point in having regrets, just focus all the energy inward and towards something positive. And thanks, im not asking you to trust anyone especially not me... thats why there is no fee collected on contracts, it should be like utorrent, fully peer to peer with no middle man, a protocol, not a company.

What I have learned a long time ago is that this world is like a jungle, you can almost trust nobody in this world, especially when money is involved. At the end of the day all of us human beings are selfish in essence at their very core, me myself included, it's not a bad thing though, it's only a bad if you seek to fulfill your selfish desires at the expense of other human beings. I think people like us belong in a different category of most human beings in that we seek to fulfill our selfish desires and ambitions by creating value in the world whereas most people in the world just want to take value away from other people. See yourself as standing above the latter category, Bob and others like him are subhuman filth, parasites of society and the world would be a better place without such people.

Coding takes time. Lots and lots of time. So the progress we made so far i think is great. There is no other wallets that do contracts within them. And no other wallets with markets. But sometimes, i need to take breaks, life can be hard and gets in the way. Anyways, you are totally right. Its a jungle, people are still hungry, fighting all the time. But there are people who try to overcome their desires for a greater cause. In order to be that kind of person one must always question themselves and what they hear. They should absolutely never assume what they hear is true but actually its better to assume that what they hear is false or at a minimum, flawed. Otherwise, we make assumptions, form dogma etc. But to be that way is a lonely path, you can't have beliefs that are too strong, must be willing to change beliefs at will and suffer the fact that most people believe lies. Perhaps its just the way things are. Hopefully it will not be this way forever."

        "We at BitBay are excited to announce a new marketing campaign. We are going to host a Pay to Mail or (P2M) giveaway! Bounties will be given for registered participants! P2M is a relatively new feature of BitBay\u0092s Market Client. This feature allows you to send Bay (BitBay coins) to friends, family, merchants, etc. Whether you simply want to tip a friend or utilize it as a payment option with a trusted counterparty, P2M is a great feature that\u0092s fast, secure (backed by bitmessage technology), and has no fees included other than the typical blockchain miner fees - which are fractions of a penny. Many people in the crypto-community find and invest in currencies with real and unique applications,but find themselves wondering how they can help promote adoption to support the developers and build a stronger community. This P2M giveaway creates a perfect marketing tool that anyone can use to help out! Remember, BitBay will eventually peg its value to create stability for the Client\u0092s Marketplace. The peg value is yet to be determined, but imagine if you participated in this \u00a0giveaway and completed just one P2M - you will receive 1,500 coins. If we peg the price to 1 cent (0.01 USD), your Bay would be worth 15 dollars plus change (if you stake the whole time)! That\u0092s a nice ROI (return on investment) as it\u0092s free! This is our first giveaway contest for the Client. More giveaways to come in the future - see end of article for details! Anyone can enter this P2M campaign, yet currently the Market Client is only compatible with Windows. Mac and Linux will be added soon. You must register to be eligible to receive bounties. Registration begins October 10th and must be received before the end of October 16th, UTC time. Bounties will be provided for registered participants! The P2M campaign will run from the beginning of October 17th UTC time till the end of October 23rd UTC time. For new users you must install the Market Client in order to participate: \u00a0\u00a0- Download and install the core Market Client version 1.21 Links are provided in our BCT OP, the bitbay.market website, or our old site - bitbaymarket.net \u00a0\u00a0- Now setup your Market Client. Refer to our Get Started guide for help or just follow the setup wizard built into the client. \u00a0\u00a0- The Client must sync 100% before it will allow you to utilize P2M. Synchronization usually takes around 5 - 8 hours. We\u0092ve created a bootstrap to speed up the process. It generally cuts the sync time in half. Instructions to install bootstrap. \u00a0\u00a0- Currently the BitBay Market Client is compatible with only these email providers: Gmail, \u00a0Hotmail, Outlook, AOL, and Mail.com. Others will be added in the future. Gmail users sometimes experience an issue with the client synchronizing to your address. To fix this check out our guide in our website forum. \u00a0\u00a0- With the help of the Get Started guide your email should now be synchronized with the Market Client. You are now ready to send P2M\u0092s to anybody as long as their address is in our supported email provider list mentioned above. \u00a0\u00a0- Send a P2M with 1 Bay(coin) to our campaign email address  .  \u00a0\u00a0- If you are new to the Client to send a P2M, you simply enter the receiver\u0092s email address in the \u0093Send BitBay\u0094 Tab, \u0093Pay to:\u0094 \u00a0entry field. \u00a0\u00a0- Once we receive your P2M we will record your email address and return your 1 Bay. This is your confirmation that you are registered. \u00a0\u00a0- Each registered participant will be allowed a maximum of 10 P2M\u0092s that we will honor with bounties. \u00a0\u00a0- Begin by sending 500 Bay to people you think might be interested in BitBay\u0092s decentralized marketplace. P2M allows you to either send a default message and image or a custom message and image. For the sake of the campaign we require that you create a \u0091custom message\u0092 with the \u0091default image\u0092 to your friends.  \u00a0\u00a0- Your custom message should read:  \"If you download and install the BitBay Market Client, 500 Bay will automatically load into your wallet. Goto bitbay.market for Market Client download link (not the QT wallet). You are also eligible for an additional 1000 Bay. Simply forward the P2M message you received in your email account to  . Then send a P2M with 1 Bay to  . Your P2M must be a custom message stating that you received the Bay from [sender\u0092s email address] to be awarded the 1000 Bay.\" \u00a0\u00a0- Once we receive the P2M from your contact, you will be refunded your 500 Bay + awarded 1500 Bay. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0- The Market Client is currently only supported by Windows, so remember to only send emails to friends with access to Windows OS. Mac and Linux versions will be included soon. \u00a0\u00a0- If they don't download and sync the client, they will not be able to receive the Bay. If so, the Bay are automatically refunded to your wallet after 10 days. \u00a0\u00a0- If they receive the 500 Bay, but don't send 1 Bay to  , we have no way of knowing about it, and will therefore not be able to refund you your 500 Bay. We believe that if someone takes the time to install the Market Client for 500 Bay, they will also claim the 1000 Bay. \u00a0\u00a0- Any attempt to play the system by sending to yourself or sending multiple times to the same person will result in no bounties or refunds. \u00a0\u00a0- The emails are received almost instantly, but it takes longer for the Bay to arrive in the client. 20 minutes is quite normal. During testing we have experienced a few delay issues with bitmessage (to be fixed later). We therefore recommend to have your client running as much as possible during the campaign. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This P2M giveaway contest is the first big push of our community\u0092s marketing campaign. It\u0092s a community effort that anyone can join to help us spread the word on the potential behind this truly decentralized marketplace - no more middlemen! As David continues to update the Client with the final template releases, we plan on creating an OP in every language available on BCT. Bounties will be negotiated for that. If the turnout is higher than expected for this P2M giveaway, we will announce more in the future and could potentially change the rules. For example, a P2M giveaway where bounties are given to users who confirm P2M\u0092s to eBay and etsy members! The sooner these merchants and buyers see the potential to save money, the faster we can spread our adoption worldwide!  Don\u0092t forget we also have a built-in faucet inside the marketplace, which as far as we know is the first of its kind for a wallet to allow. It\u0092s limited to 1000 Bay per user. So hurry before it\u0092s depleted as any new faucets in the future will be determined by the price of BitBay. To receive your faucet today, you simply have to join the BitBay Faucet market in your client). The faucet allows you to learn the simple process for completing your first BitBay market contract from start to finish. So keep your eyes on BitBay. Our community is mainly active on Slack. Feel free to PM David or Munti on BCT for an invite to join our team on Slack. Enjoy the giveaway!"

        "People who invest in Crypto should understand something and its probably why a lot of devs quit. Its because... they aren't real devs. Software can take years to finish even with teams. In the past 10 months, we released decentralized markets that actually work, made major enhancements to the core client, have an auto-translater that translates to 92 languages, a crazy UI with forms that are interactive and mutate as you make different choices, and even the first templte (coins for cash) released with a built in Bot/price tracker. And the full list would take up this page. So relax, it will happen soon enough. This type of attitude is unhealthy (pure obsession with price). Pegging will certainly help this issue that plagues crypto but people must understand that this isnt like making a website on wix or microwaving your dinner, its more like this, \"programming is like building a luxury car from scratch piece by piece without an instruction manual or any help from any previous models\"  And its more like building that car with your bare hands and only a hammer and screwdriver. Its just time consuming. Lets take an example: Diablo 3 took 10 years to make and they had a staff of 5,000 people. Bitcoin was probably not created by one person (Satoshi was probably a group of people) So on the contrary, we are moving extremely fast considering im the only dev. But im not a machine, sometimes i even take a day off! (i know its crazy) And i can assure you programming destroyed my social life... lol So be patient, its not a race, its a marathon. If anyone here invested for a quick return then best that they sell and move into some sort of pump and dump (i think Kittycoin is good enough for that) Bitcoin was worthless for about 3 years... you couldnt even give them away for free (for example Lily Allen turned down 300,000 or so bitcoins when they were worthless), i dont think people were sending Satoshi PMs saying \"when will your software be worth something some day?\""

People are getting so tired of it, heck even the scam devs are running out of fuel to make more scam coins. This is actually great to see unfolding. Bittrex is averaging about 2 pages of coins without any volume except for traders buying their own shares. Just a few months ago I thought there was about 14 pages of coins on bittrex. Now it's almost down to 10 pages. Just 3 weeks ago c-cex put half of all their coins on the delist countdown! Within the next 2 months, we very well could be nearing the top 50.

We have quite a bit of that already. What we need is for the world to know that, and want to test it themselves. We really don't want David to spend his time on marketing instead of coding, so it's up to the community. And obviously, the community is all of us. There is a lot ordinary Bay holders can do to help without any special knowledge -Write articles and/or help getting articles published (Probably the most important thing you can do) -Help checking the translations in the client if you speak other languages than english -Test the client a lot so you really understand how it works, so you can start helping others that need help -Make tutorials (video and writing) -Start selling on the market, so newcomers see that it can actually be used. No need to wait for templates to do that. Custom contracts do the job. -If you happen to have a web site, link to  -Post in this thread to keep it alive even though you don't think you have anything important to say. -Encourage those that spend their time to help Bay.

        "Thanks munti, yes awareness is clearly important. As far as devs, I'm not sure anyone would be able to work on Halo core without costing me more time training them. I've tried to hire on that at least 10 times and always failed at it, wasting more time than it was worth. If we had VC funding then that would probably not be as big of an issue. However, I COULD use a dev to help me build cross platform builds for linux and mac. In fact, I've put a request on r/blackcoin for the same thing. They would not need to code anything in the core, just work on compatibility issues with multiple different linux and mac platforms which is a real headache to do alone. Otherwise, judging from the progress on this code we could be more than half way there. Earlier in the year I was trying to rush myself but then I realized I had to focus on performance and bugs as well. So a lot of user friendly updates were made (like languages and updated \"pay to email\"). And honestly some of the updates would have been impossible without the help of slack. The community members on slack have helped me locate bugs! And that help is something i cant measure. Its been very useful to see how it works on all the different systems. So before honestly my desire to finish gave me unrealistic time line. However, as you can see progress IS being made. The new template is out, the rest are already graphically designed and from there ive got to finish coding them. Then when thats done, there is a huge question of what exchanges we can get to run the pegging software! One option I have is to finish Blackcoin NightTrader exchange and that would be based on the smart contracts through a microtrader. But in order for that to run with no latency, I need servers so that could be some dramatic changes to all the Halo clients. Of course that also takes time if I choose that route. If I peg before that, then we need to figure out which exchanges we want to put it on who can use the two asset classes (Bitbay and Bitbay reserve). And there is still updates to the user interface as well! (We need to have the client recognize frozen and liquid assets and reflect them in the balance!) So this is all going to take time, months obviously. But I'm going to try my best to get it all done as soon as i can. Hopefully I can get everything before the upcoming summer. Also realize, its not possible for me to move on with my life and any other projects until this is done! So of course, I would love to finish and will work my best to get it as soon as I can. At least in the meantime, we have contracts and decentralized markets... which is pretty damn good so far."

        "First of all, thank you to David and team for continuing to put forth effort into the Bitbay project. I've been holding BAY since the IPO and will gladly continue to do so. BAY is a long-term project and I'm in it for the long haul.  Bitbay's time will come.  With that being said, I have a few questions/concerns that can hopefully be answered. First of all, is there a future ongoing marketing plan for BAY?  If so, when does the team feel implementation should take place? I understand we have a new website and forum but it does not seem BAY is actively being promoted on a consistent basis.  The last facebook update was 2 months ago: The last tweet was 2 months ago: The last forum post was 2 months ago: I understand that a majority of the communication and interactions take place on Slack, but from a regular person's view, it looks like not a lot is going on with BAY.\u00a0 Most people that want to know more about this project either check this BCT thread or possibly our subreddit.  The subreddit has not been active a while either: I know this sounds like I'm bellyaching and complaining, but I'm really not.  And everyone would be totally justified by calling me out on my lack of effort trying to promote BAY.  I could definitely be doing more and contributing to the project. I'm hoping to correct this in 2016 by dedicated a bit of time each month promoting the great tech behind BAY.  Maybe it's a blog post?\u00a0 Maybe it's a tweet? Maybe it's emailing influencers and introducing them to BAY. I'm not sure but I will begin trying something.  Either way, I feel more can be done to ensure (and give confidence to) potential new investors that BAY is thriving and advancing (as we all know it is). A simple updated tweet, facebook post or forum update more frequently would go a long way, in my opinion.  Just my .02 cents. Again, a big thank you to David and all the cool kids on the team helping him out. You guys have my utmost respect and soon all your hard work will rewarded. You guys are building something amazing. The world is waiting.  ________________- ____  _______________/__l /_l  _____________/____v__l  ____________/________l  ___________/_/________  ___________V_________  ___________/_________  __________/___________  _________/____________  _________/____________  ________/____________/  _______/______l____l_l  ______/_______\\____l_  _____/____---- __\\____l  ____/__/______\\_ ___I  ____l__/_______)_\\___l  ___/___________/_\\___  __/\\__________/___\\___  _l _____ _______)__ ___)"

Things have been slow the last months because David and other members of core team have had to take care of things in their private life, but when Christmas is over we should be back on track. I wouldn't worry to much about price unless you plan on selling now. For a long time BitBay was doing better than the average alt, now it's falling more than the average alt. In the end I believe it will be about average. Besides, BitBay has always been able to bounce back, and unlike many other alts there is a little volume on the trading. Check volume on bittrex for say the last 4 months."

That said, meta has announced on slack that he will post any announcements that others send him. But so far no one has done that. You are more than welcome to help out with that. I wouldn't say we   a marketing plan, but we are working on something. If we are able to pull it off, it should be amazing. Imo the crypto community is just playing the bigger fool game. We will therefore target real end users. After all, unlike most alts, we have a coin that you can actually use in daily life. The marketing should start after we have implemented all main features of BitBay, meaning templates and pegging should be in place. there is no point in introducing end users to an unfinished product.  This is still gonna take a little while, so we probably should focus a little on the crypto community while we wait. The problem is there is not enough of us working on it, so we have to prioritize. You (and maybe others?) wanting to help out could remedy this, so I'm very happy that you intend to join us in promoting BitBay. Thank you for caring. Send me a pm with your email, and I will get you on slack if you'r not already there"

Since harddrive crashed is why I had to add the .dat files. Strangely enough was at the same as the Bitbay wallet stopped syncing. Don't think wallet needs to sync to make password work? Not that big a deal only had 300 000 Bitbay, but it made me rethink the value and aggravation of using or \"investing\" into any altcoin. Decided to sell out all altcoins and put it all into BTC, since with the halving coming up , analyst predict a 50% jump in value on BTC \u00a0and predict BTC hitting over 4k USD a BTC within 2 years. \u00a0Wish you good luck with Bitbay and have a Happy New Year"

A vendor would much rather have the piece of mind knowing an arbiter is involved that is impartial and not have to lock up funds, that really should be a discretion on the buyer side that he may have his funds locked until he receives his item(s). It does open up a can of worms of knowing who to pick as an arbiter, because it has to be a trusted person who has incentive to do good, so you must design around that and create the incentive structure for the system to work. It cannot fully trustlessly on mass scale in this way unless you get an insurance agent involved somehow to provide the collateral for you for a charge. That all being said, something using CLTV however may work using time locks and extending time locks somehow and I think David knows this.. however it is alot of GUI work to get this right, and more moving pieces, more complications, more unit tests.. but ultimately might be the optimal solution. But at this point 2 of 3 is probably the best way to go."

And whoever enters a contract will have an incentive to fulfill the deal so they can get their deposit released. The problem for vendors would be a different one. If a power seller from ebay started using our market he would have to have an enormous amount of Bay to list everything he is offering. We are discussing solutions for this. Basically we need an option to reduce the deposit for big sellers/buyers. We could make that dependent on the rep system. We can also make it possible to allow frozen Bay to be used for deposits. The positive side for investors is of course that a lot of Bay will be tied up in transactions if the market is popular. Just imagine, how much Bay will be in double deposit if average transactions are $1000 a day. How long is average listing time (where seller has put down deposit) before someone enters the contract? 5 days? 10 days? How long does the transaction take when buyer has entered the contract? 3 days domestic and 10 days international? Pick your numbers and do the math. We can easily have a situation where an average of $1000 daily transactions can create an average demand for $30 000 - $50 000 worth of Bay."

I was goin to implement the double deposit escrow but after thinking about it a bit and speaking with other notable people I came to the consensus that the best idea is to have an arbiter (buyer pays a fee which he gets a 0.05% cut out of the deal IFF he signs off on a refund or release, otherwise doesn't get a cut), and have done the GUI for it which took the longer than the actual feature."

There is a little about this technique on our site  David has also explained this a couple of times in this thread I believe. Basically it goes like this: I post my iphone for sale. I define the price, and have to send a deposit that equals the sell price to a multisig wallet. You want to buy it, and accept the contract. In doing so you send me the Bay I was asking for, + send the same amount to the multisig. If all goes well we both ask for the locked funds in the multisig to get released. They will get released simultaniously to both of us, and only if both of us asked for it. If I send you an old shoe instead of my phone, you will be pissed, and you will not release the deposit. I will have gained nothing by sending you that shoe instead of my phone, and thus there is no point in doing so. If I actually sent you my phone, but you claim I did not, I will not release the deposit. Again, that makes it pointless for you to try scamming me."

        "You are making this assumption that its an \"up front cost\" but its not. The deposits would be similar to your daily/weekly volume. If you did 1000 dollars of business a week, then im sure you have at least 1000 dollars around for deposits. Also of course you CAN set custom deposits. Why do you think it has to be 1:1? If you have a 100 dollar item, followed by a 50 dollar deposit, then you still lose 50 dollars if you try to cheat the system which should be significant enough to prevent you. Using arbiters is a terrible idea. Bitcoin is anonymous you have no accountability for arbiters. What is to prevent an arbiter from colluding with himself in the deal? Example: Arbiter is ALSO the buyer or seller in secret. Thus he has 2 keys of the 2/3. Guess what? He can just steal escrows out-right. And coins are anonymous so there is no stopping people from doing that. Why is it that when we make extremely significant steps forward, people are still trying to force everything backwards? Third parties are the thing we are trying to avoid? How the hell does an arbiter know who is lying? We have been over this time and time again. I'm not sure who you talked to in the industry that gave you that bad advice but I know we have talked at length about it.. I really hope you change your mind and stop trying to move society backwards? What next? BitLAWYERS? BitJUDGE? BitJAIL? BitJURY? Please, thats the old violence based society double deposit is trying to rid the world of. The whole point of double deposit is to make an agreement or contract that obviates the need to use a \"gun\" to enforce contracts. Arbiters are not wise, they don't know who is telling the truth and people will take advantage of that and then nobody will want to use crypto. Then explain to me why not use Ebay?? Bitbay/BitHalo/BlackHalo have the extreme advantage that you don't have to trust a third party to \"judge\" your deal. Ebay is fraught with scams, true they\u00a0 don't happen all the time but even I've run into them. But the debate is much deeper than Ebay. Its about International business International law. Tell me, if I sent a wire transfer to buy Bitcoin to someone in Nigeria how will this all seeing all knowing arbiter going to know if I sent the money or not?? He wont. THAT is why we use two party escrow. Because its the FIRST time in history contracts have been International, Trustless, no third parties, no lawyers, no judges, no bullshit!!! No more need to threaten a person with a \"gun\" if they hurt you in a contract because the penalty is already built in!! Its the worlds first PEACEFUL contract. And yes there is a reputation system, so we can track how many deals youve done successfully. Trust comes when you know a person, if they have a good reputation then you may choose not to use a deposit at all! Or make it like 10% of escrow value. Even 10% is still a loss to anyone trying to default. (and if we trust them, those odds are very low)"

        "The only way I can see double deposit escrow working is if the vendor's deposit requirements fall in accordance to some reputation which itself is another variable in the system that must not be gamed. I went with arbiter after talking to vbuterin for now, but with CLTV may change it later so that the buyer can renew an expiring lock on the funds by paying a small fee. ( a more complicated design needing more review and better UI) If the buyer is the arbiter the seller won't ship, the seller should ensure this before shipping (the only thing extra they need to do)... yes it is a tradeoff and the arbiter has a dynamic reputation built that can be pulled from the blockchain db history by looking at past trades. Perhaps later on I'll use a trustless design through CLTV once i get around to trying it again in the new core (just updated to latest core again today which includes all the unit tests for CLTV). Even in your design you involve \"trust\", so the gun logic applies to double deposit aswell. If there is \"trust\" then deposit requirements begin to fade, just like if you \"trust\" that the arbiter will do his or her job then no deposit is required from either side (most efficient way to achieve network affect before a fully trustless method is discovered). So 2 of 2 involves \"trust/reputation\" to minimize deposit requirements, while 2 of 3 involves \"trust/reputation\" to resolve deadlocks between parties with no deposit requirements. Here are my unit tests for escrow if you are curious:"

        "The \"only\" way?? What are you talking about? It works already. Wanna prove me wrong? Lets enter into an unbreakable contract and you can go ahead and try to break it. See what happens. This is just the standard tired argument that someone will default. Its never happened and we have run 1000s of contracts and if they are the type of person to do that they will be poor quickly. Also DDE is the only escrow that would work in a \"cryptoanarchy\" or for that matter in areas with no trust, or situations without trust, governments without trust or just standard barter. And you are saying the \"vendors\" deposit? Are you aware there are like 1000s of use cases for this? Its not just for shipping boxes. It can be used in wires, telcom, employment, outsourcing(especially useful here), political contributions(imagine if the politician had to honor their word in a unilateral crowd funding contract), high risk contracts, any unilateral contracts, barter(especially interesting)... cash for coins etc. Arbiters cannot determine WHO is lying so they are an unnecessary expense. By the time you did 100 deals but paid 100 arbiters 2% congrats, you just lost double the amount a deal would normally cost you... i highly doubt the odds of losing in DDE are more than 1% even. Probably even less. No less than the odds of getting screwed on Ebay which happens a lot and yet the 2 party method is FREE. Does the arbiters at ebay do their job when a person gets scammed? No, they don't... they have a policy that favors one side. Does the court system incriminate more guilty people or innocent people? Would you not have better odds by flipping a coin? Look, you want the world to stay the way it is then fine. But there was an escrow company in california that ripped of the HUD for like billions, there was escrows disappearing with millions during the meltdown, it happens constantly. Escrow can ALSO collude with buyers/sellers in conspiracy if the price tag is high enough. But not it 2 party escrow, none of that will happen since there is nobody to collude with. 2 of 2 does NOT require trust. Only if you wanted to lower deposits (and even then there is no profit motive since there is still a deposit that you would be losing not to mention future business). And seriously, why would you? I would rather never lower it in my own personal experience because people usually can't be trusted to do their jobs. This escrow style is the definition of trustless. Why are you using a trusted escrow in a trustless technology?? It makes no sense and no explanation you give me will make sense because its not logical. Then just go use the Dollar, go use Ebay and Amazon, go perform jury duty and judge your peers, just use standard methods of transaction if you think there is no room to improve it. Mt Gox STOLE .5 BILLION dollars. IF they used Halo for their wire transfers, people would have gotten those wires back!! No fucking bankruptcy protection, hell no, they would have gotten their money. IF any Bitcoin marketplaces that used 2 party escrow (especially darknet) used it then you would never hear about these 100 million dollar escrow thefts in crypto. MORE THAN 40% of Bitcon has already been stolen do you know HOW? By ESCROW. Sheep marketplace, Silk Road, Mt Gox, Mintpal, Bter, not to mention OTC thefts. 2 of 3 does not resolve deadlocks either because it will REWARD EVIL. If a person is evil, they steal, escrow cannot possibly decide who was right and who was wrong (they guess of course). The guess will reward bastards and the cycle continues. That is not a resolution in my opinion and i know there are people here who share it. Actually everyone should share it because its just logical. Its a better way. And vbuterin is wrong, i thought he was supposed to be a huge cryptoanarchist, why would he not want 2 party escrow?! Its like the best ideas are staring him in the face and he ignores it. You cant put everything in the world on a blockchain. Do you want your social security, photo ID on a blockchain? I would hope not. Also, like I said 2 of 3 system has a huge vulnerability. The party can pose as escrow and buyer. You said \"they cant pose as both because seller wont work with buyer who is also escrow\". But of course they can and they WILL. Let me explain this attack in more depth. Lets use open Bazaar. I decide to make 100 fake profiles in OB. Then I build up their reputations. Then I enter into a bunch of deals, scam the people, favor myself... dont do it too much at once of course. I know the public keys which are mine so there is no way the system can hide this knowledge from me. And if I have a 100 profiles being chosen at \"random\" would be like being chose all the time. Then finally the attacker enters into 100 escrows with different parties, this can be asynchronous too because there is no way to tell which profile was built up or not. They then take all the money which could amount into 100s or 1000s of bitcoins. OR MORE, just keep attacking forever. Fake profiles are easy to make. Bots can almost do this job(bots can be trained to comment, and basic logic, even built with what to do in certain scenarios). Very tempting too if you live in India, or Zimbabwe and your monthly income is like 20 dollars. So working full time to make 1000s of btc?? Huge incentive to spend all day doing escrows. Easy attack to perform, they control both keys, they knew they could take the coins early but its a long con. This is why you don't use 2 of 3 in Bitcoin because Bitcoin users are just random people on the internet and have zero accountability and are totally anonymous. Even if you used a way to identify users they can fake those (fake ids are easy to use, hell google images since we are doing this all electronic) And you said \"before a fully trustless method is discovered\". 2 of 2 escrow is the ONLY fully trustless method. Why? We dont trust third parties to our transactions, we arrange all the terms beforehand and only deal with our counterparty. Nobody wins from bad acting so only good acting results in a successful deal. An extreme example, you and me we deposit 100 bitcoins each for a cash deal that costs 1 bitcoin. Are you really going to break it? Didnt think so. That is trustless."

        "DDE is more secure and it is trustless I already said that. However for the working world it is not convenient due to the requirements for vendors and consumers. It won't catch on UNTIL reputation system is baked into the deposit requirements based on some metric, OR everyone accepts that is the wayt o do business online (unlikely). Escrow fee is only 0.05% so not enough to scam people unless done repeatedly many times on high value escrows (unlikely). Arbiters are usually chosen as well known entities that are impartial and have to know how to decide which side is right in a mediation. It is not perfect, but it is a tradeoff and lets people to use a decentralized marketplace with out stringent deposit requirements. I believe for the security enthusiasts or paranoid the best is to offer the option of DDE so if the market is pushign towards DDE it will take over otherwise keep working with 2 of 3. Again CLTV might actually help with this and we can come up with a better trustless design (later on) for 2 of 2 than you currently have implemented. btw there doesn't seem to exist a totally decentralized technology, there is some centralization(trust) in all our of designs, it is a matter of trading off some security for usability and let the market take care of weeding out scammers (just an incentive's problem and nothing more).

        "Well you are right, the barrier to entry is getting consumers to get used to deposits when they are still trying to understand what Bitcoin is. Have you ever had a conversation with someone where they ask what you do and you say Bitcoin and then you find its impossible to explain it to them without spending several minutes and answering a bunch of questions?! You said arbiters would be known for their reputation on judging. But how does making fake profiles not do that already?! You can still judge the deals you see... people would rate you as fair. Once you get trusted, you simply can scam all you want! And besides, who decides which arbiters are scammers unless there is an arbiter who judges arbiters? And when an arbiter is being \"fair\" to one person they are always being \"unfair\" to the other person. The other will complain if the arbiter goes against them regardless of guilt. And also an arbiter can boost their own rating by acting as buyer/seller and arbiter. So they also fake buyer and seller accounts too. And since there could be a lot of money on the line, this is an extremely profitable attack. The other thing you mentioned was the low arbitration fee (less than 1%). But then WHO would you get to sit around their house part time judging crypto deals all day when its already hard enough to get people to use Halo Markets or Bitbay or NXT Freemarket etc. So i think the fee is not going to motivate them and if anything it will not be enough to motivate them to do a good job. The advantage to DDE is speed also. Because neither party needs to wait for an arbiter, if the markets become unpopular they still can do an escrow. You know what you should do? Give users the ability to request an arbiter. Why not do 2 of 2 and then if there is a dispute they can elevate it to 2 of 3 (this way arbitration is seen as a last resort and only entered in to upon mutual consent.) Or just offer both 2 of 2 and 2 of 3 or 2 of X. I think that arbiters creates more work for you. It means sys needs staff members or dedicated people willing to do that job for such a small amount, it means building in the third party UI and back end. Its also less autonomous. In theory DDE could converted to etherium style distributed contracts. But these contracts have the advantage of not having to be held by a blockchain but by the peers. Either way, you have always been nice to me and no matter how you code it i'm sure it will go amazing! Nice job on those tests with lock times. You've got my support."

The size of the escrow fee is irrelevant for scamming. Scamming would be by collusion or the same person have both an arbiter id and a seller id. He would then sell something with himself as arbiter. Buyer would send money, seller doesn't send, and arbiter rules in favor of seller (himself). 3 I do agree that we might be able to come up with better trustless designs in the future.

I wouldn't do 2 of 2 and elevate because that is the worsed of both worlds (a deposit upfront and central arbiter deciding for you later).. but perhaps offering both as an option for merchants to decide which one they prefer is an option. I've already built the UI for arbiters and for DDE there is no UI needed, however I didn't see much merchant adoption with it so to start off its 2 of 3, let's get it going and if it picks up then add the option if people are asking for it. Yes arbiters can fake their derived reputation, even using large amounts \u00a0because fees are so low they can sign off on their own offers, arbitrate them and users have no way of knowing that the arbitration was fake. I think the idea is that if your buying something of value from a merchant that you have no experience with, you use an arbiter that is well known and fair. Remember this is just to get the marketplace going, once it goes we can start to switch to more trustless mechanisms... and eventually replace the whole escrow mechanism with one that doesn't need arbiters."

So if you look at my whitepaper at bithalo.org it talks about how this is done. Future transactions can be made, malleability doesnt disable the bomb/timeout tx because the software will delete the keys anyways. And to further secure the bomb you can use an instant refund, a tx based off the funding txid. But nobody uses instant refund anyways since the person who pays more broadcasts. Canceling a broadcast doesn't do anything, it just wastes everyones time. Once the funds are in escrow there is no way out except working together. The instant refund can also delegate someone as the broadcaster. Mind you none of this interferes with simultaneous deposit into escrow. After all, its ONE tx signed by two different people. (in theory we could do crowdfunding 100/100 signatures or use anyonecanpay signature schemes) TX1 Bob---> Bob temp TX2 Alice---> Alice temp TX4 Escrow------------------->Timeout/Bomb tx presigned by Bob/Alice TX3 Bob temp-------\\ \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 ---> Escrow Bob/Alice Alice temp------/ The timeout is signed in advance before Alice releases tx1 raw. This prevents early broadcast. Only Bob can change txid of the bombtx disabling it. But since the one broadcasting is the one with more at stake, it is counterintuitive and it also wont prevent parties from key deletion Now this CAN be done with checklocktimeverify using the temporary tx is still a nice idea for fee reduction but its not totally necessary since ive changed how that calculates in Halo Bob/Alice--> multisig 2 of 2 checklocktimeverify until X timestamp then only redeemed by 1BitcoinEaterADIOS(for example) Timestamps are better than blocks mind you as ive seen a slight inconsistency in block times which is unacceptable for timing end users on a specific destruction date. Everything in Halo is extremely specific, the time starts from the timestamp arranged OR funded. Dont forget our timers need to match. So whichever is earlier. Checklocktimeverify could in theory change that timing protocol and we need to be careful on delayed sign/broadcasting Bitbay only Complicates things BECAUSE funds can freeze changing the requirement to send certain inputs And this changes at least twice a day!! So realize that Bitbay(pegged) needs to send at least 2 copies of the TX. One with the current rate, the second with the rate changes in both directions on broadcast maybe even another copy with a timelock of 3 months to bypass any rate change with at least 10 points locked up respectively. Under the hood this is like a Ferrari man. The whole advanced planning for these deals is meant to keep them trustless. I could literally talk for hours about protocol. I've got a lot of work left to do thats for sure, it will be rewarding no doubt, but patience is a virtue."

        "Hi,  I just wanted to say I really like the BitBay concept and appreciate the work that's gone into it by the devs and the support of the community. I can tell that there is a lot going on with it and I wish the project every success.  However, I just have one or two issues that are proving a bit challenging at the moment, so any help with the following would be greatly appreciated: 1. My Halo client v.1.2 on my Vista PC (32 bit) is not syncing, it appears to be stuck at 85%. I've installed what I think might be the latest version on my Windows 7 (64 bit) laptop (v.1.21) and it's reached 100%. So, I backed up my private keys from the vista machine and I've been failing hopelessly at importing these keys into the client on the laptop?  2. Is there some definitive instructions anywhere for doing this? 3. Also, it would be helpful if there was a link posted here in the forum for the latest client download as when you visit the website, the download appears to be the v.1.2 and not the v1.21, which I can't seem to find anywhere now? 4. I've also installed the QT Wallet onto my laptop and it's finally synced up. So, I was wondering whether it is possible to import the private keys from my Halo client into the QT Wallet? I've tried using the [importprivkey] command in the debug console, but with no success? I get a code 5 error message? I presume you enter the command and then the private key, but I'm not sure what label etc to use, or whether or not I need to add the public key as well? Anyway, right now it's a bit frustrating because I don't have access to my Bitbay coin balance, as the client with the balance in it is the one that is stuck at 85% and the client on my laptop refuses to acknowledge or recognise the backed up private keys. Maybe that's because the PC one isn't up to date? Like I said I'm very supportive of the BitBay project and want to help where I can. So, any help with the above would be much appreciated. Thanks"

        "Okay so if the sync is stuck, probably just restart the client and wait. If you continue to have the problem maybe some other software has interfered with it or its been a long time since you last connected. If that issue persists please send me your debug.log in the bitbaydata folder. The thing about your keys, the Halo markets client uses two keys (not wallet.dat) so are you sure you are importing the correct file? When you set up the client I'm hoping you used the wizard since its instructive, you were asked to make two .private files. Those two files are your account (its multisignature). When opening a wallet, you should open both files. If the computer is new, and it shows a balance of zero and its fully synchronized and those two keys were manually loaded, there is a button on the bottom that says: \"rescan\" press that. There is a documentation that came with the client. I'm interested to know when you downloaded the 1.2 version. 1.2.1 runs as an update, the client (should)\u00a0 automatically ask to update when you run it. But if it doesn't the update can be retrieved here:   ... thats the link to the updater... it should patch the client. And lastly, you cannot import keys from Halo to QT and you certainly would not want to even if you could. Halo uses TWO keys, not wallet.dat its those two .private key files (and did you store those in jpegs? because then they are hidden inside jpegs). If you somehow were able to import the multisignature address manually by importing the public keys as \"watch only\" which im fairly sure you didn't do, that can cause your QT wallet to get corrupted IF it receives staked coins to it(this actually happened to me back in the day when i kept mixing wallets and sharing the same data directory... i had to create a special program just to extract the coins). Because then you won't be able to spend from the QT wallet since the wallet will try to spend from the multisig and not have the private keys that correspond from it. (QT only knows how to use single keys, either paytopubkey or standard addresses)"

I have a pretty nice guitar that I decide to sell on the Bitbay Market. I want $1500 for my guitar. Someone likes my guitar and agrees to buy it for $1500. With DDE I have to deposit $1500 in escrow to make the transaction, correct? My problem is if I had $1500 to deposit, I'd probably use it to pay the rent and keep my guitar.

        "If you are a seller, since the buyers money is advanced to escrow if you put zero the risk is still somewhat smaller for the buyer. 3r was saying that its close to zero but actually the guarantor contracts allow for zero deposits. Which is useful the new users of the markets. The buyer in a guarantor contract can then put a smaller deposit with the seller having zero or smaller deposits. In the end even with a small deposit, you don't want to lose money. For example, seller is selling guitar worth $100 he doesnt have much to deposit so he deposits $10 buyer deposits $20 In the above case would seller forfeit $10?! Probably not, people don't throw money away for no reason. Although sure, there is a small risk he stops caring. When the buyer receives the guitar and needs to sign for it does he want to forfeit the $20 deposit? No why would he? Besides, he received the item, is he really willing to destroy 120 dollars not to pay for the item received? So the idea of forfeit in a small deposit use case would still be illogical. Combine this with a reputation system like we have and i think the odds of default are still LOWER than the odds of getting scammed on E-Bay. (Because in e-bay there is a way to PROFIT from a scam whereas in the above scenarios its only a LOSS). Besides, the hope is that honor and the \"hand shake deal\" will finally be restored to society. Back in the days before stupid laws and frivolous lawsuits, people used to use their word literally as their bond. Honoring your word meant everything. In this case we have the added bonus of a penalty built into any contract. Reinforcing trust. And if crypto was to take off and be popular its hard for me to imagine business being done any other way. Because if you use traditional escrow, on international contracts where laws vary from country to country there is literally nothing stopping people from default or theft. (Mt Gox) Even laws in the most developed countries are not very effective and maybe its because there is no deterrent inherently built in to our contracts. In any case, shouldnt there always be a small penalty or incentive built into every contract?!"

And so, there are pieces of the total which are premium and subpremium liquidity (a diagram would really help to explain this one). Some liquidity would deflate/freeze faster than others. Some frozen assets would be more valuable than others. Very similar to a trustless futures market. The entire system is fractional. If you have 100,000 coins frozen to be released over 50 points, and want to send 3/50ths of it, then you get the next group divisible in 47ths.  Everything is under the hood, so you will probably not realize this is all happening in the client (other than knowing what is frozen and what is liquid) I'm not sure publishing a white paper early is a good idea since it only fuels competition. However for those that really want a technical breakdown, you will get one pretty soon."

        "Yeah you are correct, if he is a buying a lot or selling alot. But look at it this way. If you sell 10 items per day then you are probably making very good money, If each item nets you 100 dollars, and turn around time for your deposits is daily, you only need 100-1000 dollars tied up at once. Which is okay. If you make 1000 per week, its reasonable to think you had 1000 to insure your business. Think of it like free business insurance. I should mention, you should read Halos documentation. The part about the \"change management\" system. Its breaks up the outputs to denominations for buyers and vendors who want to do large volumes.  So it breaks it up 1 5 10 50 100 500 1000 etc... This allows you to do many contracts at once with multiple denominations. So actually I think the custom deposits is more of a concern with low volume sellers, not high volume. Because someone new to the markets will have to take a guarantor contract in order to buy their \"first coins\". Or if they are not making a lot of money either, they are more poor, coming up with a deposit might be a little bit harder. The same is true for pegging. Because a person who is always tight on funds will have subpremium liquidity(set to freeze faster) since they will spend any funds that were frozen almost immediately."

        "The peg might not be hard set at a dollar because that (might) require freezing a good deal of coins, we will roll the peg upwards to that target and see when the volume increases and choose the target price by voting. Of course we could set it to a dollar but that might impact volume if the price gets too high we can inflate again. So we should release it and roll it up to the target gradually. The coin itself will be the market maker. It will certainly be much higher than this price though. The only challenge will be making sure the exchange doesnt oversell and runs our API. So the API will return two classes of funds: Frozen and Liquid. (or maybe BitBay and BitBayReserve not sure of the name yet) Those two classes of funds mind you are on the exact same blockchain, its just that the exchanges need to tell you if funds freeze while on the exchange. It wont impact withdraws since I'm adding an exception to allow transfers of frozen funds with a 3 month time lock. Blackcoin and Bitbay have similar limits to Bitcoin as the block size i think is the same. However UNLIKE the stubborn Bitcoin foundation we can do whatever the heck we want. So if we need to allow bigger blocks, then we will. If we decide on a lightning network, we will. Lukcily, we dont have to worry yet. Bitcoin of course has a serious scalability problem. And I'm thinking the lightning network certainly helps take the load off it. Because you can link IOUS through a payment network. It (could) works like this: My version of the lightning network is a bit different from the Bitcoin foundations... but the theory is the same. Lets say there are only 5 people in the economy. Bob, Alice, John, Joe and Sara Bob and Alice set up an account with each other Sara sets up an account with Bob John sets up an account with Sara And Joe sets up an account with John NOW when you want to make a payment you route an IOU. If Bob owes Joe money, he tells Sara who tells John who tells Joe and they each carry the debt to their neighbor. And this can be done using micropayments. They do it using locktimes, each settlement clearing every month or so. But they RENEW those debts monthly. If they dont renew the debt, they report it to the blockchain. Thus the blockchain is only used to report errors. Accounts are set up so early withdraw is allowed but debts were written to replace old transactions. Servers can hold on to copies, so can peers. In any case, they might only care about what is relevant to them. They would want to know, how much everyone has and check those balances with their peers. In the end, the blockchain is only used to report errors and early withdraws or transactions made outside the lightning network. This was one interesting solution to bloat that I've seen. Of course the blockchain can still get bloated but mostly it would get larger to due notary. Multisignature might get more complicated on a lightning network though. Im sure the theory is the same though since only debts are routed, there is no reason we cant build on it in the same way, multisignature accounts are still just accounts. Each time an account is made, you only need to find a person to pair with. If you are stuck not finding a pair then just do the transaction on the blockchain which would be a last resort. In multisignature, can a 3 of 3 or 10 of 10 account find itself in default if an angry partner broadcasts early thus allowing their pair to interfere and withdraw? And what if they collude with the pair? So there are legitimate questions about the limits of lightning network. And one might just be certain types of multisignature and notary exchange. Now with freezing and unfreezing on top of lightning networks things might get really complex. Most likely withdraw transactions will need to have copies that bypass the freeze with 3 month locks for the maximum inflation or deflation predicted in the month. Bitcoin foundation had the idea of lightning network where everyone shares with a central hub that routes payments. But that solution is pseudocentralized since if the hub goes down everyone needs to withdraw. Whereas in my example, only the effected parties withdraw. And its more decentralized. Technically the lightning network works because of locktimes. You set a locktime for a payment with a temporary private key and to replace the payment you make another transaction where the lock is sooner so if they try to spend the incorrect one, the key is revealed and you can take their money since you hold a version of the transaction with an earlier lock! Its pretty cool stuff."

        "Anyways, scalability is still an issue. However with Pegging currencies it might be possible that people can issue their own currencies for each community and peg it to other larger ones. Thus, their blockchain is secured by their community and buying and selling those can be purely based on their resale value. Im guessing Bitcoin needs to be rewritten entirely and Etherium is making the bloat problem worse. Of course, both those currencies are heading for a centralized future whereas we are looking at a decentralized one. Pegging and lightning networks are a huge step for that. Combined with smart contracts its almost an entirely complete, self surviving economy. It should be noted, the smaller the economy the more likely the trust is broken and the higher the probability for conspiracy to large aggressive groups to take funds from people. The bigger the economy, the more likely the blockchains rules are kept honest however the hard it is to fork and the harder it is to prevent centralization. Technology might get better and help us have bigger hard drives and more bandwidth so there is still hope. There is a sweet spot somewhere here. So we still need to make sure any economy is large and has a good method of P2P fraud prevention and verification. Etherium contracts should definitely be stored off the chain. And preapproved by miners as safe. So they are just really making the problem worse unless their end goal is centralized servers."

As to the US dollar and hyper inflation, that's an unlikely scenario as well. However, if that should happen, it's not a problem. I assume you have noticed that David has been talking about a \"rolling peg\". That means BitBay will not be locked at a defined value versus US$ forever. Think about BitBays peg as a stabilizer. It's there to remove the volatility that you normally find in small markets like altcoins, bitcoin, and pennystocks. With the peg in place you can expect BitBay price to move more similar to mature markets like fiat, bonds, and blue chip stock. So, since the price is allowed to move, we can compensate if there are big movements in US$. If the US$ should become totally erratic, we can always peg to any other currency or commodity. A mix of currencies would be my preferred solution. I suspect that's what we will do in the long run, but we have to start somewhere, and pegging to US$ is where we have decided to start."

        "Yeah I'm aware of this, however the pegging proposal here is a decentralized fractional system. So coins are tagged as to how they freeze and unfreeze. Example, lets say the deflation rate is 50% And someone had coins that he never spent since it was 100% inflated (0% deflated) Then he tries to spend. Miners force him to send 50% back to himself tagged as frozen 100-50 which is basically his coins divisible in 50 parts. Then the remainder he wants to send is now liquid 50-0 which is liquid coins set to deflate in at least 50 parts. If the currency inflates again the user can spend some of his frozen coins. Lets say it inflates 5% Then he can unfreeze 5/50ths of his frozen coins and tag them a liquid divisible in 5 parts over 5 points. Merchants will always require good quality coins and this is all going to be done under the hood. Frozen coins can be transferred when totally frozen under one condition: That you put at least a 3 month time lock on it. At least im leaning towards a 3 month exemption but it should be in the range of 1-6 months. This is superior to NuBits because its totally decentralized. There is no custodial addresses, there is no sustainability problem, there is no voluntary parking. Nubits suffers from major front running/inflation/centralization problems all of which are solved here. This creates a series of asset classes based on how much liquidity your coins have. It also allows us to roll prices up and down by controlling the supply. AND it doesnt favor the rich, anyone who held coins that froze will benefit by having them released later. And also it creates some really interesting possibilities for transfers of liquidity for frozen coins. Similar to loans, trustless bonds and futures, etc. Thats the core idea, I've been in discussions about how to make it user friendly which is the first priority. This is the basic core principals and we can build on it from there. Deflation/Inflation per day will probably be 1-2% and might follow a sort of linear curve where that is more of a target rate. Although im still deciding over the minor details."

I'm not sure if I should explain that here or just save it for people to read somewhere else for the ones who are really curious. There is a few challenges in helping users understand it. There is a question of what basic users need to know. Should they know that different coins freeze at different speeds? Perhaps if they request it in the client, sure but it will not be immediately visible. Minimum liquidity requirements for sending can prevent them from noticing that their coins freeze slightly faster or slightly slower depending on which ones they received. I could explain much more technical details here but perhaps it would be too much. hahaha At a minimum, they need to know their funds freeze and unfreeze. The end goal is to make that the only new concept for basic users to understand."

        "This brings up another question: The vote can be done by majority, but majority votes are hard to calculate. Here are the two ways I'm thinking of coding it would like to hear what you guys think: The first way is to give the vote to the miner who wins the block. Since everyone has a fair chance of winning a block, this lets anyone who is staking make the decision. This way is provably fair since staking is fair. Its harder to game and you burn less funds. However, this might be less democratic if you consider the people with the most coins usually get the blocks. However, the people with the most coins have more at stake and perhaps the votes matter to them more anyways. ALSO this benefits users who have frozen coins and gives them this added benefit of being the bank. The second way is based on a voting address. Basically you can cast votes in the client, send a small payment to a voting address. This might be a more democratic way to vote but it has the following challenge: Anyone can create an address, so doing the vote by address can be gamed also if you do the votes by simply counting them, then that encourages spam So if this method is used, votes have to be measure by balance. The more money in the account the more weight the vote has. But this has some drawbacks, users dont always keep all their funds in one account so imagine voting from 10 of accounts just to change the interest rates Also to prevent people from switching accounts, I would have to make the votes happen at an exact block otherwise people would vote twice(since they could move the money to another address). This means to vote you have to be connected and miners will usually get the vote anyways. Also the most troublesome part of this is, miners would have to calculate everyones balance which means they would be running a full node. (Balance checking is not so easy unless you build an index which makes the blockchain take up tons of space) So, I think voting can be done by miners. Its clean and simple and pretty democratic. And because i dont think we are going to change interest every block, we can probably have more than one miner vote. If we change interest twice per day, then we will get about 720 votes anyways for each interest rate change."

        "Yes , miners would be a good method to cast vote for consensus . Would voting twice a day be necessary ,maybe once a week will get a solid interest rate which would give good enough time to gather up volume.  So miners voting method would work like this ,you leave your client staking then it grants you or allows you to make a selected desired interest rate or would it be in increments of some value ?"

        "Basically yes, when you are staking you would be asked to cast a vote for inflation, deflation or no change in the wallet. No vote means no change. You can always change the vote later. When you are staking it will automatically cast your vote just by sending one of the outputs to the voting address. The only reason to change interest rates once per day would be so we can see results within a month or two. Since if we all choose to deflate first (which I assume we will) then it will take about 2 months to move the rate to 60% deflated or more. If we vote twice a day we can see that target sooner. Also the question of how much should it be per day, should it be 1% or less? I like the idea of an aggressive interest rate change because the markets are volatile and prices can swing pretty quickly so a faster interest rate would be able to absorb that. However, there is a question of when we can achieve stability and what that target price is. I honestly doubt we can know the target price or the target amount of deflation because that is all going to depend on demand and what exchanges we get on. So if for example, we change interest once per day. Miners find a block every minute more or less. So we should see about 1440 votes per day. Some miners would be voting more than once obviously which is fine since they win more blocks, so they deserve it. I'm going to guess the price will really shoot up very high when we get to 90% deflation and more. But the market might surprise us and do it sooner. Then again, I can hold a special vote in my wallet for changing the interest rate potentially if its really needed. Those types of things will need to be decided eventually. Also, its probably worth pointing out that the rate changes will probably not be compound. I'm thinking of making it a linear curve. So 1% for the first 50% then maybe .5% for the next 20% and so forth. But it might just be compound. Or I might have it be part of a parabolic equation that makes it move at 1% for a while and then as it approaches zero the rate of deflation slows down exponentially until it hits the maximum. Because the system is fractional(not based on decimals or floating point numbers), I probably have to mark coins in billionths. Since you have at least 1 billion coins. Although I'm not sure I want to do that yet either. It really comes down to math and protocol. As for time to gather volume, thats a good question. If we started at 100% inflated and just voted to deflate 1% per day, then how long will it take to see the volume spike? I'm going to guess that will happen as the people notice the price gradually rising. But maybe if it was slower it would also be better?! These are all really good questions. Again, I'm not sure anyone knows the best answer here. We are in complete NEW territory. This has never been done in the history of finance before. Although there are examples of countries doing market pegs... munti would know more about that than I would though."

        "Yeah very new territory for sure.  I had it in my head that when a miners is staking the client will automatically vote for the prefered interest change (inflation deflation or no change) the user selected by percentage starting at 1 percent everyday collecting data for 100 days ,so if someone wanted to deflat to 90 percent everyday till 90 days you will vote for deflation then the last 10 day no change. After all that data is collected by all the users the system will takes the highest deflation or inflation value and freezes that percentage of coins for 3 month and any new coins made from staking will also be frozen plus it would be cool to lower the staking to .01 percent to make things easer and inflation be less for the system.  Once the data is collect from the vote the system will check what the value is of bitbay in satoshi and maintain the increase percentage that was voted for, in this example 90 percent so the system will freeze and unfreeze coins to maintin that amount for three months. Maybe just make it more simple what ever percentage the community votes on the system will just freeze that percentage from everyone cilent even the exchanges and that includes any new staked coins you get in your client for three months."

So yes I agree the miners should be the basis of the deciding factor as it give incentive for people to stake and support the blockchain. Yet as David's mentioned it's more geared for the heavily invested coin holders. I think we ought to give incentive to merchants as well to diversify. I'm sure the merchants will be using a lot of coins in DDE and thus won't have their true 'power of voice' over the investor miners. Yea, I'm sure the merchants will be staking whatever coins they have left over because they earn more coins, but it won't be the true potential they deserve. That being said I think their ought to be a multiplier effect based off a reputation system as well. It would help even the odds verses a group of individuals that are highly invested in the coin but don't use it for anything else. This gives the small 'fish' incentive to use the coin and gives their vote a much more even playing field."

Also, it is fair to mention the progress made on the client in the last year (comparing screenshots alone) a lot of features have been added and of course the decentralized markets. The people we have on our team are mostly the slack members. We have a couple people who did graphics mostly meta who did our site which I have to admit looks excellent. And the slack members helped find artists for the new logo, promotional materials and everything else which I made sure everyone we contracted got paid of course. The reason the QT is buggy is because it was not built with complete source code. Oxidians github is missing files so it cant even build bitbayd for some platforms. I have a more updated source which is good for the daemon but it wont run qt. It would be nice to see a new qt but we have to consider that very soon it will be phased out. I might even fork early to get rid of the qt before we even start to peg. I just bought a new laptop today actually for testing and may buy a couple more cheap ones just to see a few different systems. Aside from any VMs im going to run. By the way, to avoid the sync, you should look at how Ive coded Bithalo. That version of Halo actually doesnt download a blockchain. The reason i download a blockchain for Bitbay and BLK is because I want to make sure the data is 100% reliable (like blockchain.info). I used 3 different apis for Bithalos balance checking to avoid mistakes at all costs since these are contracts and we cant afford unreliable info. HOWEVER, since Im coding a decentralized exchange, technically im going to have to start relying on online block explorers for altcoins. Plus, i dont see why bitbay cant do both once that functionality is complete? Just a though. I'm trying to not promise more than I already have on my plate though. Some sales have been done on the Bitbay market. Someone sold a tire pressure gauge, trading cards, cash for coins, fawcet contracts, stickers and promotional materials. So I think thats a pretty good start for our first year. Hell the only thing anyone ever bought with Bitcoin was a pizza! For like 10,000 btc haha The reality is, I would LOVE coders. Did you know that I posted to find someone to simply build a cross platform blackcoind and bitbayd build on reddit and on a few job search platforms and found absolutely nobody?!? It was sad, I have a hard time simply getting a damn build. Of course, Im going to build those myself but to get them cross platform and stable requires some testing and ive been working on other things. I was in Cambodia, tried to hire, had 3 coders who didnt contribute a single line of code. Sad i know. I spent 1 month training them and after saw the sluggish speed of how they struggled and gave up on them. Two of them quit. They only really managed to build the daemon, get blackcoin and bitbay running and they practiced on some small projects i gave them that took them forever. A thing one of them took an entire week to do, i did in one hour. So I tried to look into India, was there for a month, but found out that i need to apply for a 3 month or more visa from the usa and India doesnt take bribes anymore haha. So that was out. Plus they are ballbusters anyways. I was concerned about the training issue and time commitment since I knew I had to produce markets asap... ( so i did   ). I tried hiring a guy from Blackcoin under a BlackHalo contract for a basic refactor. At first it was good, he did a decent amount of work (proof that double deposit works!) BUT he started to get lazy after 2 weeks. He had a bunch of things changed with file management, cleaned up some stuff etc. The problem was, I was working on the code at the same time and we werent using github. SO he was frustrated since I didnt merge the code, he asked for about 5 time extensions and eventually disappeared completely. So the contract ended. Unfortunately, I ended up not using a single line since I already refactored the file mangement in Halo core myself. So I also tried hiring a few other crypto guys but they take weeks to respond and just suck. They either dont understand my source code, or are obviously planning to pad their hours. (where are the good cheap ones hiding?) I'm looking into hiring here in Mexico... since I'm not far. And the quality and price might be alright plus i speak spanish. But its very hard to say again if they will understand the code or bitcoin. Coders are hard to find. Bitcoin coders are impossible to find. Cheap bitcoin coders are like unicorns... they dont exist. So, I'm stuck coding alone. And by the way your assessment was correct. The amount of work for one coder is insane and unhealthy! But we've made it this far, this client is like 10000 times more badass than any client out there. Its STILL the only client in the world that does contracts, still the only one with true decentralized markets, and like 10 other cool features. On a side note about marketing, to bring in some extra cash and to help a buddy out, I spent the past week making some marketing bots for a friend... and maybe they can be useful for crypto related projects. Mostly for forums, online promotion social media... all automation bots. The thing is, I'm not so interested in marketing heavily until the pegging is complete so we dont worry about volatility. By the way, are you on slack? Its been a bit quiet there lately."

        "thanks david for the very detailed answer. I can only imagine how hard it is to get guys who can actually help with this project. I know you have posted on various places for help. Do you think there are any devs on this board that we could inspire to come work with us on this. I mean are there not vital (less secret) tasks they could do? but still the work they would do would really help boost us on. I was wonder if the community could all donate some bitbay to a big developement pot which we could use to bring other devs on to the team to assist you with your work I think we should keep all the coding or as much as possible of the vital stuff to for you knowledge only and closed source as possible until we have a clear lead in the areas you have been working for so long. I mean if we could raise say a few million bays in a pot do you think we could bring on another dev or 2 from here to help us? then again we would ideally want them invested in the project not just dumping our coins back on the market. If we could devise some ROI projects for bay that would be good too. Thing is nobody really donates much unless they get something in return or else everyone sits there waiting for everyone else to donate for projects...the secret is getting them some return for donating ....even though a higher price for BAY should be a good enough reason it doesn't work because even those that don't donate benefit the same as those that do donate. Shame we can't think of a way to reward those that donate only. Or even reward for doing tasks - if we had a pot where you did various tasks and got paid with bay that could be useful too. Even so I'm very impressed with the work done so far. I think people are just unaware of this project right now. If we could get on poloniex that would really help along with btc38. It's a shame the wallet is so buggy i wonder if that can bring consideration from poloniex?"

The syscoin dev hangs out here, but i know he is super busy on his project... most good crypto devs are busy with their own thing  Ive got some Bitbay I could chip in, I've not spent any of it since the launch. In fact, I bought a little bit when it was low at 40. But you know a dev might want BTC? I'm not sure but its an interesting idea. We could look for devs in reddit at r/bitcoin or even on odesk. But finding a cheap one who is trustworthy who doesnt procrastinate and who follows through is almost impossible. This is why I'm looking into Mexico. Plus I've got tons of friends down there. In the meantime, I'm here coding! Right now setting up my new computer and building distributables. The speed of my updates will pick up very soon! Now I'm home, no distractions and just catching up on work. Only the QT wallet is buggy. The markets wallet only has a few minor bugs but nothing that interferes with markets or contracts. Poloniex is almost definitely looking for VOLUME. That brings them money and low volume will not make them want to bring it on. Hopefully when I get to coding NightTrader that the decentralized exchange will be fast enough that people will want to use it. I'm still facing some speed decisions. Either way, this year we should see the complete client."

        "i totally agree with it, and this is where me and david differ in oppinions although we are in sync with the end goal, the path we choose are opposite, I feel that in order to disrupt this market you must work within the current guidelines and offer interim solutions before the market adjusts without shock and realizes they can cut the middkemen out entirely. Case in point, here in vancouver we have a huge rei bubble going on, with rei agents shadow flipping properties by front running real bids and reselling properties before their closing within 6 months making up to $300k in some deals at little to no risk. The superintndnt of rei was issued a mandate recently to discover tools and processes to combat this type of problem.. What me and my coworker thought of is this, although i pitched him the blockchain concept he convinced me an even more naive solution was required to patch the prblem first.. being able to audit the process of bidding on a property as a buyer represented by an rei agent. So we have mls.ca and they process the sales and transactions and have an api, mostly a pull api to get info.. We simply force them to allow pushes and track bids of buyers represented by rei agents.. You cant cut rei agents out of the loop initially, the politics amd corruption reins up the ladder and it wont happen, atleast not with government help. So you now can audit via mls and have to trust mls is accurate if courts look. Then you offer a system that lets you track via a blockchain whereby you can issue something like a syscoin certificate to an rei agent, one to the bidder and have the pair required to place a bid on an offer (to sell the property).. Since rei agents are supposed to provide value in terms of competitivr bargaining on behalf of clients as well as provide insight into which properties the buyer should bid on it would require that the buyer would work with an agent to place a bid. Lawyers would need to be involved to oversee the documents that thr rei agent would get signed by the buyer that he can legally place bids for the buyer and it can be stored in th certificate data section as a scanned image or hash of a document. Now if it goes to court the judge can simply see what the rei agent did and confirm the buyer allowed them to bid, aswell as the buyer would br able to audit what the rei agent is doing for the buyer, all with ability to prove that you were the owner of certain certificates because you own the private keys, and you signed a notary witnesses document for the rei agent which is part of your certificate. When the sysoin offer is sold the commission is assigned to the rei agent and buyer pays the property price through an escrow. This id just an example off top of my head where you work in steps to solve these problems..  Later when market realizes that you can discover prices through some online metric and you can filter out properties you ewnt to bid on, you can lobby to remove the rei agent out of the equation and have direct buyer seller interaction without the need for lawyers or middle men, the final step in the evolution of the smart contract for the everyday world."

        "There is an extremely lucrative real estate trick that you can do very similar to the one mentioned above. Anyone who wants to make a killing can do this although its not entirely fair to buyers and sellers. Its called \"double escrow\" not to be confused with double deposit. Basically, in real estate you offer a listing an exclusive option in exchange for a dollar or whatever they accept. The option agreement might give you a few months to decide to execute. Then you secure an escrow company to find a cash buyer. You underbid on the house you optioned (like a 1 million dollar house you offer 900,000). THEN you find a the cash buyer who wants a 1 mil house for 950! Next part is easy, you set up two escrows and pocket the difference. This amazingly is legal! It doesnt even need to be disclosed in some states which is totally ridiculous since most RE transactions require disclosing things as ridiculous as a ghost being on the property! (like how could you prove that)... Anyways, the difference in net is zero risk for the person securing the escrows. They make 50,000 on a deal they were never involved in. Double escrow was one of the many reasons for the real estate crash because of inflated prices and the ease of the deal. Now consider that there is another deal much more effective since it eliminates you completely and you operate 100% as a silent middle man. You do the same, underbid on a million dollar house at 900,000 but maybe do it to 100 houses getting the options as cheap as possible. Then you shop the underbid portfolio to buyers and their real estate agents. This is called \"find and assign\". The find and assign technique is just literally options and selling the actual piece of paper since you add a clause in the contract to make the option assignable. Now you are an invisible middle man who can net anywhere from 1-50 thousand dollars per assignment depending on how awesome you got the bid. (Imagine if you bid on a hotel or a bulk amount of land, the assignment becomes extremely valuable if the bid was good). These are examples sidhujag just like you mentioned above. Good business models but totally contrary to a realtors fiduciary responsibility. Find and assign is more ethical than double escrow since the lack of disclosure is a little unfair to the parties involved. As a realtor, I am forced to disclose double escrow here in california but in some states i think its still okay. In fact, these deals not having a license is better than having it since there is absolutely no fiduciary responsibility. Knowledge of the law actually hinders you. Traditional real estate is totally corrupt. Especially zoning laws which have basically zoned off grid living out of existence and is a direct infringement on the freedom of mankind. Anyways, sidhujag you are actually correct in your assessment that people will take a very long time to warm up to smart contracts since it requires them to think differently about everything they do. Also it moves consumers from a \"trust\" society to a \"trustless\" one. Of course its superior, but it takes time for people to adjust. I hope they wake up sooner than later. Hopefully one day people will decide they have had enough of middle men jacking up prices of everything."

Basically your underbidding and flipping to buyers who dont underbid so much but they deal directly with you and not the seller? That seems like shadowflipping kinda cause the re agent will flip to a buyer by underbidding and hooefully getting a property then turning around and selling without putting anything down, just his name on a paper...

The risk is that if closing happens, the re agent is on the hook.\" That is incorrect, an option contract forces the seller to accept at the option price. Perhaps you dont know that exclusive options cannot be broken or the seller will face a very serious lawsuit. It might even jeopardize the title. In Exclusive options the buyer pays any amount of consideration (even a dollar is legally binding) in exchange for the delay to execute the offer. Its identical to an offer, there is only a delay. So yes the sellers cant break those and thats why double escrow is possible in an option agreement and so is assignment(exclusive and nonexclusive). There are people who made millions doing this and still do. Imagine if you faxed the option to 1000 listings, secured 50 from $1 to $1000 in exclusive options and each option is a 1-2 month option. And you can sell that portfolio via assignment or double escrow and pocket the difference. Also in double escrow those escrows are done simultaneously. The offeror never goes on title actually, he just is a middleman between escrows, and in some states an undisclosed one at that. His first escrow is secured by the second one. And they usually find cash buyers which makes the transfer seemless. In the case of assignment, hes not involved in any way whatsoever. He is literally selling a piece of paper. I know that seems funny but its not because the option will almost definitely have a clause for assignment. Thats the whole reason a buyer would want it since the seller is forced into escrow. The agent is absolutely not on the hook. This is all allowed in the law. Its the seller that would be in serious trouble. The law not only allows middle men, it encourages them. That was my point. Its actually a real estate secret. Very few people know about find and assign... but you can see on google there are certainly wholesalers and consumers that do it."

Make it easy to use any coin as the escrow deposit. The client (or a contract?) would trade the deposited coin to BAY at the start, and trade it back to DOGE or w/e it originally was when the contract finishes. Perhaps even downplay the fact that BAY is the underlying token so different coin communities would have less objections in adopting the market. There would obviously have to be a fee for using other coins because of slippage and exchanges taking their cut, so when people get familiar with the market and they want smaller fees they'd perhaps start using BAY directly. I suppose the above would ideally utilize a decentralized exchange, but perhaps ShapeShift's API could be used in the interim. \"A secure double deposit escrow market for any coin!\""

But yeah, as you already know about the NightTrader exchange, that is going to be a very critical question of if I do that or pegging first. I think the exchange needs to be at least in Beta first because we need a place to trade frozen assets and also a place to trade Bitbay if no exchange accepts it after the fork. The NT exchange will support many coins, microtrading is a way to trade any two coins. However, its a bit heavy on the blockchain. Unfortunately, there is no way that I can think of (yet) that does contracts between two currencies. Especially since the payout should at least be in one currency. The way might be do to atomic trades but thats extremely advanced if you also do those trades on top of contracts (since the trades are time locked and contracts allow for extensions). I'm not sure how a contract can be made with multiple currencies at this time. (maybe it can be done with some advanced time lock tricks or a lightning network in all of the coins) Not all coins support time locks which is exactly why NT exchange is microtrading. Although i've considered green addresses for a slightly less trusted method. The ultimate decentralized exchange is definitely a lightning network that is coin agnostic since those can all be done p2p without reporting to a blockchain."

        "I got to thinking David - since the intial ICO was a total scam, and you were left with basically nothing except your BAYs and a few btc (which really was for smartcontracts software which you have given to bay already) to fund the rest of the development of bit bay as opposed to say etherium that got 18M dollars worth of BTC... what amount of BTC would it take to get you going with hiring the devs and setting up some decent marketing for BAY? would be nice to have a marketing guy /graphics webdesign i mean a team instead of just you having to arrange and do it all really. I mean there is away we could raise a reasonable amount of BTC... If you could outline how many BTC it would take and a plan of how it would be used to best effect i think there is a possible way we could raise this? If there were away to  1. increase interest/awareness and belief 2. Increase dev funding - totally transparent and a ledger - released only in agreement with community for confidence and involvement..  3. get volume up and on to other larger exchanges 4. reward those\u00a0 who still believe and support the project - with real viable rewards. surely those would be good things? Perhaps we can get BAY to where is should have been if the ICO wasn't a totally scam resulting in the bay ico investors and you getting shafted...and those 3000BTC had been put to devs, marketing, projects ...just think where BAY would have been. What was the ICO price is sats for BAY - i forget now? I think something can be done. But how many BTC would we need to raise to make it worth while? Of course it's not all about the BTC i mean generating interest and new belief in the project is as important.."

        "Nobody will donate anything as is always the case. Perhaps we'd raise 0.1 btc from donations. To be honest why would anyone donate time or effort when the rest of community will donate zero and reap the same rewards? We have to talk about incentives here and long term plans. There needs to an incentive - nobody will donate but there will always be interest from investors. The fact we have  1. 100% proven developer who is skilled and honest 2. a product that is already a good away there 3. a coin that practically nobody is aware of that if they were aware of and it's possiblities they would be very interested in having a share in it. 4. a bunch of holders that once believed in the project and still for the most part retain their coins...and that are willing to invest in a good opportunity. We have quite a few options. But normal donations will NEVER work. If we diluted your share in BAY by 2 but increased the price in BAY by 2x then you have lost nothing at all. If we diluted your share in BAY by 2 but increased the price in BAY by 10X then i have 5x your money. I believe it is not essential to dilute your share even as much as by 2 and increase the Price of BAY by 100X or 1000X Of course if you want to increase you bay worth in USD terms by 1000X then you will all need to work at it a little bit and get involved. Infact if you were smart you would increase your share in BAY and assist in increasing the price of BAY by 1000x or more. It depends if you believe in David and his talent at the end of the day. I do and will do more than my fair share. Of course when people mention figures like x 100 x 1000 it sounds like fantasy. But in crypto these returns are possible given the correct conditions."

        "The amount needed to raise for a serious software development project to be honest a few million is a minimum. What Etherium raised was surely enough... it was sickening to hear they dumped their coins on the market to give themselves more money. Vitaliks own admission, he said they were running out of money (how? it sounds like gross mismanagement). And people accused Bitbay of being a scam? Holy hell, if Etherium can sell their own coins on the market after already selling 15 million dollars with vaporware how is that fair. Very good coders are hard to find so in order to pay devs you need to raise big money. There has been many articles on this exact subject. There is a lot of venture capitalists putting money into crypto but the problem is, they cant find the developers! So consider that a good developer is at least 100K+ a year. Really, a crypto dev might be double that or more. So the only way the ICO would have worked is if the guys who started pitched in anything. The funny thing is as most of you know, I was already in Asia and was already hiring devs for the NightTrader exchange. So the guys who started this didnt even help me hire even though they promised me that Lin would help find coders from BTER and China etc... it was just all lip service (along with their promise that at least 500 btc would start in the dev fund). But there is no point looking back on it, now i know in the future to be more careful who i license my software to. I also know now that I should have been asking for much more up front and to carefully look over their finances. I had just never gotten offered a deal that I liked and when they asked me to get involved with this one they made a lot of promises and I didn't want to lose the deal so I just didn't ask enough questions early on.  The good part of it is, i really believe in the rolling pegging system. This could all be a blessing in disguise. I'm a huge believer of turning negatives into positives. Sort of like a midas touch. When I complete the pegging system it will be the first time ever that an electronic asset can protect its own value and it might give the rise to private blockchains that are more resistant to price drops. As for rewarding members of the community, im happy to set up a bounty for people to help connect me to bloggers, crypto article publishers etc so we can publish more articles on bitbays pegging. That will also increase interest and volume i think. I can write content for bloggers, i was even thinking of going outside of standard crypto scenes for just every day writers. This group of investors needs more PR. As for fund raising? I think smaller community bounties is the best. Software developers is something we simply can't afford. I might look for some in Mexico since I'm not far, the prices are good and I speak spanish. For something like that, if I find it, will certainly let you guys know and I can pay out of pocket... but we could in theory get funds together for that since it would be cheaper. But there is no point in speculating about more devs unless we can find them and over the years ive given up trying and resorting to coding myself as usual. Another thing is, my experience with low priced developers is, they are not good for this kind of project. Since Bitbay and Halo is extremely complex coding, this is the sort of thing that money cant buy. The devs have to be taught or monitored 24/7 they definitely cant work remotely. I've noticed that if I'm training devs, I'm not coding... which resulted in the waste of money and time when i tried to hire help. Unfortunately, I've yet to find a dev that can contribute a single line of code :/ As we already spoke about it, I dont think diluting the amount of bay makes sense since the goal is just to finish the software... but i do like the idea of some new bounties and definitely better PR/journalists."

        "I totally agree with you David and i think the only reason people call BAY a scam and not etherium is this. Etherium have dumped their coins but have said they are using them for development. Yes we don't really have any transparency or any ledger for seeing what exactly they are doing with them. This is not good at all. However with BAY - it was a direct scam. I was scammed David so were the other ICO investors and even more than we were scammed YOU were scammed with us to a great extent. You see Etherium even if it is a secret scam we can't prove it yet. They say they are using the funds for development and development is happening. With BAY on the other hand if my knowledge is correct you only got 1/5 of the development fund. So the other 4/5 went to people that were meant to be developing or marketing but instead of that they took their huge chunks of BTC and huge chunks of BAY and just scammed the rest of us and gave nothing back in return. So yes BAY was a scam because it is obvious to us all those others running the ICO did nothing. In fact i think they just used you and your name in crypto to scam us all. To be fair as the core developer I would have insisted on being in control of way more than 1/5 of the development fund or at least had it all in multisig wallets. However this is in the past. You were scammed we were all scammed. Imagine though David you had 3000BTC right now? Surely that and having a comminty that didn't think they had just been raped behind you (excuse the pun) ... would be driving force enough to put BAY way ahead of where it is now. Now I take you point entirely that another core dev is perhaps beyond what money can buy right now because the new dev would have to work efficiently with you to make it worth while.  However surely there are non core tasks that we could hire teams of people to take care of on a pay on completion agreement. Not to mention payment for all kinds of managers for ROI projects etc. I mean there are a 10000 and one things people can do if you have the correct team around you that have a vested interest in the success of a coin. I obviously have no say in what happens but I don't understand how dilution makes any difference if price/interest rises accordingly. I think it is time for a second ICO...this time funds are held in a totally transparent wallet with a full ledger detailing exactly how the btc were spent. BAY2 - new coin for sale on poloniex or bittrex.. these new 1billion BAY2 are locked down until the pegging has been completed. But as a reward for investing in the project you will get to buy your bay2 at a rate lower than the current market rate of BAY1. this rate can be altered by the community and you as we see fitting to the interest and demand for bay2. Bay 2 can be removed from sale totally whenever we think that is best. They are really like long term investment tokens and who can say when they are no longer needed and could be removed from sale. Of course from the sold BAY2 - your share (david) will automatically be the same % as you had from BAY1 so your incentive remains the same to see BAY succeed. All BTC raised will go to development and marketing as decided on by you and the community jointly. You are gaining no more or no less in terms of bay but you will be gaining a pot of BTC and new interest in the project. I really see no downside. There is no real pressure to sell BAY2 at any rate. I mean if the pegging is done and we have only sold 250M BAY it really wont matter because that would have been BTC and interest in the project we would have never had and the other 750M is just destroyed. If we only sold 100M ...does it matter? what have we lost. But imagine the interest spiked and so did demand and we sold another 500M at a much higher rate...then we may perhaps consider we need to sell no more and burn the other 500M anyway? it is very flexible for us. It is really only a way of getting donations/interest with a possible nice return on them. I see no downside to this at all. But then I'm not that smart so perhaps there is one that I am not seeing? I would like to see a reasonable and logical discussion on doing this. Perhaps I'm missing something obvious that makes it a crazy idea and I'm just not seeing it as yet? Also any bay wallets that we can prove belong to the original scamsters should be nuked. I believe some were given huge amounts of BAY1. They of course will not be getting a share of BAY2 without buying in but still I don't think they should get any benefit from our hard work in the future."

Yes i certainly prefer david remains coding for BAY and without the news of BAY2 or any other big news at this moment the need for a spider is not urgent. Well am not familiar with scope creep ? is this the scope of the project grows away from the core important things we are going for? reduced freedom? can you explain more about how BAY2 would reduce freedom. Surely it would increase freedom since we are now bound by finances and man power. TBH i would enjoy peoples sceptical comments regarding BAY2 - it would be great to prove them wrong whilst increasing awareness and bringing in new members to the community. Like I said if we sold only 10% of BAY 2 what will we have lost? but I think there is a good chance we can get another 1000BTC and hundreds of members if it goes well. I mean yes even suggesting another ICO for BAY will be met with huge reaction on the board. This would be fantastic. It will be an ideal opportunity to show how honest we are with full ledger and full transparency. Whilst getting a lot of attention to the project. It is very important to remember all the ICO investors and holder are victims as is david. We are not like the scammers but the scammed. There is no harm in doing essentially a return on investment opportunity. You will see no donations you can be sure of that. I have been on too many coins in the past to know this will not happen. Doge was the only exception to that rule and that was from people i think that had 100's of millions of doge and didnt mind parting with a little. I have great faith in BAY and will hold my coins and increase as i can regardless of the size of community or speed of the project. However it would be great to have some activity in this community since it's seems so unfair that it does not get the attention it deserves or even close."

        "cryptohunter2 I totally see what you are saying. The difference of Etherium is they appear to be developing, they have a fancy website, lots of marketing and community activity, and they appear to have some code for their beta all fresh code. BUT by Vitaliks own admission, they dumped their coins on the market to get more funds and by his own words he said they were running out of funding. So that is an admission maybe not of a complete scam but at least of extreme greed and unethical mismanagement of funds. Its okay, if they deliver a product to be honest I don't care. For all I know Vitalik is in a similar situation that I was in, hes not the only one in the project. They seem to have 2 lawyers and 2 marketers for every coder. Cryptohunter to be exact, i got 1/5th of 1000 btc (191 to be exact). The ICO did not raise 3000 btc but it only raised 1500. 500 of which Bob secretly kept for himself and his partner (by telling people the 500 was his own personal investment when it wasn't and asking Lin for a refund). So thats how it went down. And even with their known shares of 200 they all kept it, Lin Steven etc and none of them helped me find developers and they other two instead of marketing paid people on bitcointalk to harm my reputation. Thats as simple as i can describe it. I told everyone about it after only a few weeks in to the project after struggling with it privately. Steven promised me 10% of Bitbay before the project started, but he never said the Bitcoin from that 10% would get refunded to himself and Lin. So that was a major detail that was left out. Regardless you guys all know the addresses of my coins and they havent moved and wont until I'm done pegging. And I've used it to pay bounties and surely can do more bounties. To be honest, I see absolutely no reason to look at investors or myself as victims. It sucks sure, but life isn't fair and in the end we rely on our own strength to get out of bed in the morning. And also, you don't lose what you don't sell. Crypto is known to be a very high risk investment. However, look at this in a positive way, if we finish there is a really good chance the market cap spikes tremendously as long as we can find an exchange and the protocol tested thoroughly. So you know, the is absolutely never a reason to look back. I was dwelling on it for a few months and it just made me sad and prevented me from working. So how can that be right? No, the only thing to do is move forward always. Be the change you want to see in others right? By the way, scope creep is a really important problem to avoid in programming. Its the problem of trying to have too many features and then keep adding them. Its the reason most projects fail. After I started coding I realized I was guilty of scope creep. And that is exactly why I now know that delivering the product finished is what matters. If for example I add a shipping calculator but then decide I want to price track that too and do 10 more things with the template? Thats scope creep. Ive decided on the design of the templates, I think the coins for cash one is really awesome. Could it link into online banks and do wire transfers and link into western unions site or stuff like that? Sure, but that would be scope creep. And honestly, I think the software is extremely user friendly. The setup wizard is good, people now know how the markets wallet works. The coins for cash and buying your first Bitbay is the first thing you see in the wallet. All the panels expand for advanced users. Its been a lot of work for me to get the UI that way. So the only thing I can do as a coder is not try to do more than I already have in front of me. To focus and do one task per day if needed. Be patient and not get upset if I lose a few days and just stay positive and work a minimum number of hours in the day just like any day job."

I know you don't want to think of yourself as being scammed but honestly if I was you and I had 1/5th of the dev funds to do all the development and the 4/5 went off to others who did nothing but try to harm this project I would feel scammed. Same for investors if we'd known only 1/5 of the donated BTC would go to the dev of the coin we would never invested. However yes this needs to be put behind us (almost entirely because if we can nuke their bay wallets i would love that done) and move on to new ways for improving bay's community and market share. For me BAY2 answers this better than any other solution put forward here. I still see no down side to it. However if nobody is interested in BAY2 i am totally up for discussion on other ways to push bay forward. The pegging needs a couple of good exchanges to test it out on. I hope we can get enough volume by then to encourage them to list/test it. I wonder how we can encourage more people to use the market place right now... I don't really wish to drag you away from your work on this... I was hoping there would be other input and discussion from other Bay members."

There are some extremely corrupt and powerful forces in this world who have their eyes on crypto. It should have been obvious that I would meet some enemies if I planned on working in disruptive tech. Halo eliminates middle men. In a sense, almost everyone in society is a middle man. It obviates some laws by reducing frivolous lawsuits. Its the only type of \"trusted\" contract that can be used in an anarchy or during wartime. It was to be expected. Not only was I upset, I still get upset thinking about it. If I could get revenge I would... you probably don't want to know what went through my mind in terms of revenge haha. But if I spent my life chasing down every asshole and bastard, I would get nothing useful accomplished. If one perishes, 3 more are born. Think of it like a tree. The leaves start to die when the root is bad. If you don't cure the root of the problem you will never cure the leaves or the tree. You need to cure the entire tree. Thats the whole point of decentralization. We focus on tech that takes pressure off of consumption and corruption. We want to take pressure off of the tree. If you have unbreakable contracts, lying is not going to be as common in business. If you have pegged currencies, you (attempt) to reduce greed and volatile markets. If you have decentralized money, you eliminate unfair power structures. If you 3d print homes out of dirt you house everyone. If you 3d print products, you solve the consumption problem (less trucks on the road things go from design to end user) If you have aquaponics and pink farming you give consumers a way to produce food in small spaces out of season and quickly If you use spirulina you solve starvation If you use water from air you solve drought (you can 3d print those structures too) And 3d printed mesh networks solves decentralized internet and media Open source 3d printed electronics solves the rest... (including cures for diseases using electro-resonance and free energy devices and robotics) Automation and robotics can get rid of a lot of unnecessary jobs in society... society should not be forcing people to work jobs that robots can do. Then you get to see the rise of robotics and automation and more happiness for everyone. This is the world we all want to see I think.

Although I think it can be done with Windows 7 actually. The whole thing really boils down to your IP address. Certainly there are devices you can use that can grab nearby wifi signals and use them for free internet. Windows 10 just shows how far our freedoms are being violated. Its too much, the things running the world arent even really human i think. Live i said in a previous post, the future of our privacy will lie in the hand of 3d printed electronics, which could be used to do a mesh network. I've got a slight interest in cellphone mesh networks as well. You guys have to understand, I built Halo with your security and encryption in mind. Encrypted emails are end to end encrypted. And bitmessage is encrypted twice and your IP is well hidden since messages are passed around making original sender hard or perhaps impossible to find. The accounts are hidden in images with individual passwords and signing can be asymmetric making hacking of your keys impossible. Its a shame Tor is compromised... they must control enough of the exit nodes or something. (or so the rumor goes) This is why Halo doesnt use Tor. In fact, combining Tor with bitcoin is a huge mistake since exit nodes can feed you false blockchain data and they can match up to your ip address. i2p has also been a little interesting But the only way to really get rid of your ip is mesh networks or perhaps leeching off of other wifi 3g and 4g systems. On a sidenote, Truecrypt is not compromised although the creators were probably given a gag order as the hid a Latin message in their warning page.  The fact that they recommend a microsoft product in its place is down right insulting Unless all of our encryption is somehow cracked using some crazy math and cryptoanalysis?! I don't know."

And lets say you are right, Etherium has fancy code. So how can that prevent me from lying to them or stealing from them?! The smart contracts we do are double deposit escrow. Heres the example... In Etherium Bob and Alice make a contract that Bob will pay 10 Eth for Alices guitar. And the contract says it will do it on the condition that they get some special hash from a shipping website proving the item was shipped. So wow! They can prove it was shipped and release the funds. But just because something is shipped doesn't make that what you ORDERED. What if Alice lies and sends a box filled with rocks??? Now Bob is forced to pay for something he didn't want and there is nothing he can do because Eth thinks its legitimate. Computers are extremely easy to lie to. Even with prediction markets, they would have to pull from many different new feeds and broadcast that, this requires human intelligence. What if the news feed is taken out of context? They want to know if \"John Smith\" will die within 2 years. What if there is an article that says \"John Smith died of laughter at the superbowl when he saw the half time show.\"\u00a0 Will Etherium think hes dead? What if there are 1000s of people with the name John Smith? The only way to prevent the shipping scam with the box of rocks is to use DEPOSITS. If Etherium wants to protect consumers, their smart contracts must be Halo contracts anyways. What if Bob/Alice want to trade Gold for Silver? How will Etherium know about the real world deliverable? What if Bob/Alice want to wire money from one country to another? How will Etherium know if the money was sent with the correct amount? What if Bob wants to hire Alice to mow his lawn? How will Etherium know he did that and how will it know he did a good job? It wont! The only way to do trustless contracting is with deposits even in Etherium!! I'm not saying Etherium isnt good for some things. Perhaps they have certain derivative applications, it would be wonderful for a pyramid pay contract, it would be great for business accounts that pay dividends, for businesses that need voting and different classes of shares. So sure, its useful for some things but the applications we have in Bitbay we are using the perfect contract and i highly doubt you can improve this protocol. If anything Etherium is extremely bloated, Bitcoin was having 24 hour delays on confirmations and they only send normal transactions. Imagine how much Etherium will grind to a halt if they let people store complex computer code!! And what about infinite loops or bugs in the contracts? They can't even be sure its secure code, the Frontier site warns that its experimental. Also you should tell them Bay and Halo have had smart contracts tested and working for years and we have a user interface that they can use with decentralized markets and everything. Just because Etherium has a protocol where is the software that does what Halo does? Do they realize it will take a person years to code what we have done here? Trust me, there will not be smart contracting software like this for at least another 2-3 years. Also, what you told them is right, they won't have to worry about price swings. There was a famous economist who said long before bitcoin that the future currency will be an electronic one with the"

Etherium is a blockchain language like bitcoin you can do Halo on any blockchain because its a method Bitbay is software that runs that coin agnostic protocol and Decentralized Markets, soon will control its own supply BitHalo and BlackHalo also do that but they dont control their supply, they just run Halo p2p software So I could easily make an Etherium Halo or Ethalo So the core difference between bitbay and etherium? Etherium is a decentralized application system that will eventually have to centralize to survive because of bloat Bitbay is a Blackcoin 3.0 clone that is more scalable since its not storing apps \u00a0and it can control its own supply The economists said the future of money is a coin that can control its own supply. Etherium does not do this making it not as viable for a stable currency So Etherium is a decentralized application distribute platform and an expensive one at that (gas fees will get to be unbearable in the same way bitcoin fees are now unbearable for low priced items) Bitcoin is more of a currency than Etherium although Etherium has more complex ways to interact with that money, its rules are different based on each application. It doesn't control its own supply like Bitbay, so that is a huge advantage for us. Perhaps the biggest thing we need and dont have is popularity... that we need marketing. The idea can be good but people need to know it exists."

        "I'm not sure I wasn't part of crypti. The thing is crypti developed some nice things. However they ran out of fund or the other devs wanted to move in a separate direction. Put forward some nice plans for lisk . Boom new ICO 1000's BTC for new development. That's what I heard. But anyway they seem cool guys and perhaps just want to go on their own and do something. To be fair David you're probably a far more known figure than either of those two guys. They seem really cool and everything but most people have heard of david zimbeck. So whilst you've been scammed out \u00a0the development pot and left to work on peanuts for years. Other\u00a0 devs are getting 1000's of BTc to further their development ideas?? that seems very weird.  We that are left here including you David are the victims. If you can come up with a perfect plan of how our BAY2 ICO funds will be used to further development and push us forward we could have an amazing BAY2. If anyone read through all BAY2 proposal from before the they would not even be released until after pegging but are an rather Investment fund. I went over the BAY2 idea several times and could find no good reason why not to run with it. It only has positives. You can have the best single coder and designer in the world but there is only so much you can do on your own. The old BAY1 community could also be revived since they are not loosing out. Instead of 100% of cmc rank 120+ they can have 50% (or more if invest in BAY2) of CMC rank top 10. I think you can do it David and you are being wasted here working with little resources. I have no idea how they convinced you to do 100% of all the dev work for only 20% of the ico funds? That alone even if they had not deliberately took their 80% and sabotaged the project. You would have still been getting screwed over. You need a large dev pot and lot of BTC at your disposal. Any negativity from the community can be quickly slammed down when we have an Open and transparent ledger for the funds and how they will be used. You as dev should take the same % from BAY2 as before for private interest and incentive and the rest of incoming funds spend on development. I have no idea why any sane person (victim ico investor from BAY1) would not be over the moon at this idea. Yes you may well be seeing your share diluted by 50% but if the project is now 100+x the size or greater if we have a great ICO for dev and marketing then just increased you gain by 50% And this ICO is practically fool proof because what we don't sell of BAY2 ICO (if it does not sell out which if we have a good enough road map and have competence to put in place which we do) is burned and never released after pegging so that dilution doesnt even take place. Of course someone with a better mind for maths, leveraging etc will need to thrash out the best way.  If other project that actually USED all their first ICO money and didnt have it stolen away can have another ICO why the hell cant we. Of course we need to 100% track down those BAY1 wallets that are linked to the thieves that destroyed this project and have them frozen down first. We don't want them to benefit from our hard work."

        "Actually the lied thats how. When i talked to Steven he said they would hire devs. I told them i was involved in Blackcoin and could not do all the coding because i wanted to finish NightTrader but i did want the work since i was doing Blackcoin for free sort of a labor of love or something. So i was already in Asia hiring devs for the NT project and figured if that didn't work out they said they had devs with BTER. I even talked to Lin and he told me that. So it was hard for me to imagine that nobody would help me. They got paid and left. Thats so wrong on so many levels i dont know where to begin and end with it. Actually its a huge regret of mine that i didnt demand to be in control of finances. But there was BTER and i doubted the exchange would put their reputation on the line. They had a lot of volume after all. And i was afraid i would not get hired at all if i was too demanding and i liked that fact that it wasnt a silk road type setup so i just sort of went with it. But yet it was very stupid of me not to ask for more, its just i had never gotten a contract that big before so from my perspective it was a blessing. And i didnt ask enough questions. Okay so on to BAY2. There is another problem i see with that. If it was an ICO, then it sets me up again for possible sabotage and not to mention fudding and insults on the bitcointalk thread. It could effect how much is raised and for me would be personally stressful. Also since i dont have any coders working with me, the problem is promising an investor something new, most successful ICOs have at least 2-3 people and partners you know. I dont trust anyone anymore unless Vitalik himself wants to do it. hahaha I know hes busy so... yeah. So yeah you know even if it raised for example 200 btc... thats not enough for more than 1-2 coders and if they cant hit their target in a year the money is gone and im still stuck doing all the work. Besides, i would have to train them too. So for it to really be successful it would need a few million dollars. Like you saw what Lisk funded?? They can hire some nice coders for that!! They really will do great if they handle those funds responsibly. The problem with wallets of the theives is its hard to track once they get split up. If you look at Mt Gox that was .5 billion dollars! They should have honestly rolled back the blockchain. It was seriously worth it because that was 30% of the coins in circulation. In our case the problem was mostly with the bitcoins. In fact, more than 50% of bitcoins in existence have been stolen (mt gox .5 bil, sheep market 100 mil, silk road a few hundred mil, mintpal bter cryptorush cryptsi and so many others) So it really is an issue even in Bitcoin"

If the ICO is transparent and full ledger then really there is no room for fudding. Everyone else left and you could have taken your BTC and ran too? You gave us the smart contracts like you were paid. I mean if you didn't believe in BAY you could have just dumped your BAY and left saying sorry there is no dev fund now. Nobody could have said anything. You have to think also. Even if we only raised 200BTC which I believe we will raise far more. But even if we did it would attract a lot more people to our community and increase interest in the BAY project. Also less dilution of the coins. I mean really there is no downside to where it is now. We either have big ico and big increase in interest and money to do things or we have small interest and don't have to dilute.  Anyway for me it would solve a lot of issues. I like the name bitbay i would keep it like that. That's my vote."

        "Yeah thats true, it would be hard to fud based on that logic. And honestly, going through the FUD helped my skin get thicker and really helped me forget about my image and not worry about what people think. Once you have had your character attacked publicly you are forced to face yourself. There is a really cool quote on this... \"Be who you are and say what you feel, because those who mind don\u0092t matter and those who matter don\u0092t mind.\" In addition to smart contracts Bay also got the decentralized markets exactly as promised. But the project isnt complete yet of course we still need the rest. Well this debate is interesting, however I don't want to take too much time away from coding. We could consider a relaunch when the pegging comes but i dont want to do anything that is unfair to investors who have stayed here and waited for ROI. I dont like the idea of diluting them. Letting new people into the market is okay perhaps at a discount since we will end up deflating anyways. It does create more work though. So i think the best thing to do for now is let people talk about it on the forums in friendly debate and later this year when pegging is done we can discuss it again since im going to be testing it a lot anyways. And yes the btc would be helpful but not yet. If it came in now, it would be one extra thing for me to worry about (managing those funds, training devs). I would prefer to simply finish the coding goals we have here and then to clean up the code and to improve the system more and all that good stuff then i would be more comfortable managing devs. Besides after i finish the templates i will probably be more interested in going completely open source instead of obfuscated python. So when we finish the pegging coding, then new devs can come in if we are able to raise funds and they will not have to work while im constantly changing the code. I know there is github for that but it would be a distraction simply explaining the code and I've had such a hard time finding reliable devs. If i finish the goals now, then i wont worry about coding as much since im caught up on work and would be much happier managing and training a dev. So we are in no rush to rebrand. Also when we peg, we can pay the new devs using frozen coins as well and some sort of bonus which serve as a future payment... if the project succeeds those coins unfreeze because volume increases so they will be motivated to see it succeed. Just another idea"

So if for example you have 1 billion coins and freeze 99% then the inputs will freeze 99% of any input. This means that if you hold 100,000 coins you can only move 1000 and the other 99,000 you have to send to yourself as change. This rule is enforced by miners. When it inflates your coins become unfrozen but you cant predict when that will happen because of voting. Extreme example: You have 1 billion coins and you freeze 99.9999% of them so only 1 coin is available Everyone would still have an equal fraction of that one coin but it brings up the market cap because i can go on the exchange and offer $100 for that one coin. This makes the liquid coin worth 100 dollars raising the marketcap to 100 billion. But thats an extreme example because you want liquidity and volume too so thats too heavily deflated. Instead deflate gradually to a target price."

Then miner rules are changed for multiple different scenarios (such as allowing a 3 month exemption if the coin is time locked) If you count the entire year quite a bit was achieved. Decentralized markets for one. However, because im coding alone, if something comes up or i lose a few weeks, then there is nobody to code.

Ive tried to build in a VM but got some weird memory issues, will be going to some local coding groups to find someone interested in assisting the build (if you know anyone who wants to help set up a VM for a bounty let me know) After those builds i will buy a cheap mac and set up a build for that too I've done some windows 10 testing with a new computer i got... windows 10 is a nightmare operating system. Aside from the spyware, it has serious memory issues and processing issues. I have no idea why anyone would use it. Nonetheless everything works. Although the OS is so unstable i almost lost a hard drive when it crashed because i was playing music. Got a faulty stick of RAM changed but i still think the Win 10 OS performs horribly. Forget that it also logs your keystrokes and invades your privacy... even its design makes my 8 processors seem like 1. Apparently, using simple programs like chrome and winamp can cause 100% hard disk usage in windows 10. Ridiculous. Today I'm working on a few bugs, if you type foreign characters into a Pay to Email, it can result in not getting encoded for email providers and not seen in the inbox. So thats being updated Also, im working on cleaning up the queue for submitted raw transactions since they are not labeled for the account and can sometimes not get trimmmed. And I'm going to check to see if resubmitting automatically to the markets has been working. You must stay connected at a certain sweet spot during the 2 days its posted and if you arent online at that time frame it gets removed and you must submit again manually. But i once did not see it submit so im going to do more tests. Also i have to test contracts with myself to see if the fee adjusting works with autoaccepting and counter-offers. It might be a series of at least 2 tests. Live tests take me time sometimes, opening and closing the program, using live coins and just repeating etc. So just for anyone who is curious, I've been working recently and we will see more frequent updates now. And for people who are not sure why there are delays, there is a changelog that comes with every new update/build. You can read those and see what was changed. Usually a lot is left out of that because there is no point to list everything. But it helps you as an investor to decide if I'm being lazy or not.\u00a0  Finally, if anyone has any bugs, please report them to me. And thank you to the slack group for searching for bugs. The idea is to try to break the client, stress test it etc. Thanks"

        "Hi guys, I've been reading this thread with interest and it's a real shame that BAY hasn't been getting the attention it deserves. The hype surrounding ETH is pretty staggering considering the technical issues surrounding it. I still can't get the wallet / app thing to work! However, no problems at all with my Bitbay client.  I already sent a listing request to Poloniex for Bitbay, and everyone in this community should please do the same to keep the pressure up. Maybe list a few bullet points as to the positive features and benefits as compared to Ethereum. DZ has already made a fine job of drawing the comparisons between Bitbay and Ethereum.  As for Chinese / Asian exchanges, have you considered approaching Gatecoin?: From their website: \"We are a Money Service Operator Licensed in Hong Kong by the Customs and Excises Department...\" I opened an account there and tested it with some Ethereum and Bitcoin, and it all went pretty smoothly. I was able to deposit and withdraw with no issues. Although, the website was a bit laggy when I happened to be there, but they were doing some maintenance and improving the site I believe."

While we have been coding first and will market later. Altough i've learned a lesson that having a product doesn't always mean people will use it. (you have to market) There has been multiple ideas for exchanges that we could add to. First this is people should let them know.

        "My apologies for the late reply. I had a lot on my plate. Download the client from OP or our site   for the latest public version. Until we get the new release there's only a client for windows. When the new release is ready we will have mac and linux as well. The client comes with an installer, so just follow the instructions. Make a backup of your keys right away. If you don't you probably don't care enough to remember to do so later and might be heading for trouble if disk crashes etc. Now you have to wait for the client to sync. This can take a day or two depending on your computer and connection. Some have reported problems connecting to the network. I can't remember if that was with the client or the QT wallet. A conf file will solve that. I can't remember if the client has a conf file with adnodes. If it doesn't you can write write one yourself in notepad. Copy paste the following into a new doc: addnode=104.236.208.150 addnode=188.166.39.223 addnode=128.199.118.67 addnode=104.255.33.162 addnode=194.135.84.161 addnode=23.227.190.163 Save it as bitbay.conf in /BitBay/bitbaydata Be aware that it sometimes takes a little while for the client to establish the first contact with the network To speed up the syncing you can use the bootstrap in OP, or use  Bootstrap is a little faster than syncing over the network, but still takes a long time. Replacing the files needed for the blockchain with the download from cryptochainer is very fast, so if you trust them you can be up and running in 15-30 minutes. Now get some Bay. The leading Bay exchange is Bittrex. When you have transfered your Bay to your client, you are good to go. If you are the first to buy or sell IOTA tokens, I suggest you open a new market for this and have others follow you there. Go to the market tab, click add/join market, and name your new market IOTA. Now go to the home tab and click custom contract. Click normal contract in the window that will pop up. New window will appear. In the dropdown choose your new made IOTA market. Tick of the other choices to your liking and click accept. A contact form will appear. If you don't want/need to supply any contact info you can type a single character in the email box, and click \"save profile and continue\" You are now taken to the \"make an offer\" tab. If no contact info etc is needed you could have gone directly to \"make offer\". The difference is that by going the custom template route fills in the correct address to post this to. Fill out the form in \"make an offer\". We recommend double deposit escrow, but you can set any deposit you want. The deposit also doesn't have to be the same for buyer and seller. There is a spam preventing minimum deposit of less than 1 Bay. At the bottom of the form you set the time for the contract. You may want to set it for just a little longer than you think is needed. If the contract expires before the deal is done, the deposit it is lost. A very strong incentive to not just fulfill the deal, but also to stick to the time frame. For now it is not possible to do this the other way around like you wanted, meaning the deposit is automatically returned if no one disagrees.  When the deal is done, both parties go to their open contracts tab in the client and report the deal fulfilled. When both have done so the deposits will be released simultaneously to both parties. Tip: You can use the client as a market for anything for any coin. The double deposit will have to be Bay because that's the only currency the client is able to freeze, but the payment could be in any coin. You can also make \"members only\" markets by adding a new market with a name that is hard to hit by coincidence."

The BitBay installer by default wants to put it in the C:\\ directory, where default place should be C:\\Program Files (x86)\\ Windows Firewall pops up needing access three times for three different programs I downloaded the bootstrap and put it in the \\BitBay\\bitbaydata\\ directory. I run BitBay, it has a UAC prompt,  . Another Windows Firewall prompt. A language prompt that needs tuning (Hello World isn't good example text, if English is default then it should display first on the drop down box, not \"Select language\", I'd also change the Apply button to say OK). It runs two BitBay processes, then three, shows a dumb looking \"Such Loading\" splash with the doge meme on it, and then closes. BitMHalo.exe process has been running the whole time, accessing the disk a little bit, but doesn't seem to be doing much. So at the end, after all this, BitBay isn't running. This is not a good user experience."

        "It should be noted, I have fought the bit.ly links and didn't think they were necessary at all. But the dev of the website bitbay.market says they are needed for tracking downloads. I would assume there is ways of doing that without using bit.ly but I'm not a web dev so i dont know. So I agree with you on the bit.ly link but i dont run the site. In fact, he wanted to host my executable and I absolute can't stand that idea but he thinks if it reroutes to davtonia.org (where all my hosting is) then people would think that is strange. There was even a debate about this on slack. So I've sort of made a leap of faith here. So instead i give the checksum of the installer basically for anyone to verify it. One process can verify the other process as well. I would like to mention anyone who wants to build from source i can send the obfuscated source and all building instructions as many people have asked for that. I've been thinking of even putting that on github (why not, i give it out anyways). Also i was wondering about .exe because some browsers dont like them. Perhaps its better to zip the installer. Still i should point out that a lot of sites still use installer (exe). Also the reason for not putting in program files is because there is administrator restrictions on some operating systems. Because in that folder i store all the files, unlike other wallets, I keep nothing in roaming. The bitbay daemon does keep its blockchain files locally everything in the same folder C:\\Bitbay\\ ... the installer gives you the option to choose a folder and i recommend against program files because these new shitty windows are so invasive that they prevent you from running as admin. Now on to firewall... that is going to be asked for ANY p2p program... this is another problem with windows babysitting BS. These messages are nonetheless standard. The reason there is 2-3 warning is because there is Halo via RPC, Bitbayd (daemon) which connects to its network, and my version of Bitmessage. Bitmessage and Bitbay are totally different protocols. Bitmessage and its modifications are the way i am able to get decentralized markets. I use what is called Channels. It also is built to protect your anonymity so unlike Tors flaws with exit nodes there is no flaw yet i have found with this Bitmessage decentralized method of communicating since the originator of a message cannot be known. UAC prompt is unavoidable, ALL versions of windows will give you that prompt on applications like that. It needs to be run that way because its running subprocesses such as Bitmessage and Bitbayd. I don't have UAC turned on in my computer. I think its invasive and a restriction on your rights as an owner of a computer. As for language selection starting on English is fine but why not have it say \"select language\"? Obviously an English speaker would appreciate the fact that its in 92 languages. I understand the \"Hello world\" default text complaint. However can you recommend an alternative? What about the rest of the client? Would you not agree this client is a million times more user friendly than a typical Qt client? A lot of thought went into this. So more feedback would be great! And thanks for the feedback. As for it not loading, are you running avast? Avast doesn't like Python. We have submitted to them before. If it unloads it will usually say why. Did you decline the ability for the program to run as admin? Thats probably what UAC asked you. It needs to do that to run the subprocess. The reason it runs two copies of BitBay.exe is because one is python and the other is the executable. This is true for all frozen Python executables. IF you want i can walk you through setup. Send me a private message and if you have a crashlog.dat i would like to see it."

I highlighted the hash discrepancy because that's a pretty big red flag to me. My environment is Windows 7 Pro x64 in VMware. No antivirus. I'm not finding any crashlog.dat re: bit.ly, if it really has to be used, might as well put the exe installer in a .zip so people don't get the off-putting warning from them. re: Language selection, I don't know if there needs to be example text at all, but if you must, maybe truncate it to just Hello, as Hello world has connotations of placeholder and programming beginners. Most language selection prompts usually just have the text \"Select language:\" above the drop down box, and English or local language will be defaulted in the box, requiring the user to only hit the OK button. Really just a minor nitpick  I see why it comes up but I mention the UAC prompt being odd because most cryptocurrency wallets/programs don't have it, and it just intuitively doesn't seem like the kind of program that would need it. I don't know much about UAC except I know I've seen options in programs like CCleaner where they can disable the prompt.

        "Right okay so I sent you a private message P-Funk, thanks for the feedback and i was almost certain it wasn't fud because those were all legitimate points you made some that i wanted to change myself. Many of the things you pointed out such as UAC for example, are not in other cryptocurrency programs because most crypto programs are not very good. They are not secure and they don't do things like decentralized markets and unbreakable contracts. This software does many things far beyond what a normal Qt can do. This is software coded entirely from scratch. Its 50,000 lines of completely original code. It does things from automated joint accounts to steganography. Its a complete crypto suite. Not to mention it works in 3 different currencies! And yes the prompt says asadmin which is a little software trick to ask the computer for example UAC to elevate to admin so that you as a software user don't have to do it yourself. And this admin access is asked for a few reasons. On some operating systems we would have bitbayd or bitmhalo(bitmessage) crash or not have write access etc. Also without admin some systems may restrict the ability to launch them as subprocesses from the console. So obviously thats bad and the only way to run it is as admin. Instead of asking the user to do that manually i let the program elevate itself from command prompt. So I also sent you a PM, i have no idea why the program didn't load after you chose the language. Did you finish the setup wizard? Did you minimize it to the system tray? Did bitbay.exe stop running? We have hardly ever had problems running Bitbay on windows 7 64 bit. I code exclusively on Windows 7 pro 64 bit with no antivirus myself. Did you let it install to C:\\bitbay\\ or did you change that directory to program files? Because some systems will not let me store files locally within that directory. This is why other coins put everything in users/(yourname)/appdata/roaming etc I would like to know more about why the program quit. Did you allow it to use your firewall? Any P2P programs need to do that for example uTorrent does that. Once you get set up I'm sure someone here would be more than willing to do a smart contract with you."

So it takes a moment to get caught up since Bitmessage holds only 2 days of memory. Okay the next thing, the whole \"error loading return address\". The prompt also says \"please check THEIR preferred contact method\". EDIT: there is another part of my code where i didnt elaborate on that text, i changed it to match. Anyways, there are two methods of p2p communication. The first is email, the second is Bitmessage. The setup wizard recommends having both. The reason i dont only use Bitmessage exclusively was because it is still being worked on by Aetheros and I want people to have a second less decentralized option of email. Emails is STILL very anonymous because it uses end to end encryption in Bitbay. So all those emails will arrive encrypted. I should also tell you that Pay To Email also uses Steganography. Anyways, you can contract in either Bitmessage or Email but a person who posts Email as their preferred method of contact will not accept Bitmessage offers. Perhaps i should allow them to use \"either\". But that would require changing a good amount of code and i dont have time to change that. So to respond to that fawcet contract you should set up an email or ask 3r to post one where bitmessage is the preferred contact method."

You can add an email on that tab. I like the suggestion about allowing people to run through the setup wizard again. Its true once they skip it there is no way back to it. Also you CAN save information you enter into all contract templates. If you are at the home screen and you try for example \"Sell coins\" or \"Buy coins\" you will see an option in that panel to save the information for later. This means you never have to enter it twice. Only when doing a custom contract there is no save option."

        "Well currently slack is helping me find bloggers and places where we can publish more articles also I've been editing some articles they intend to publish (somewhere) As for the Buying and selling of coins at Abritrage I LOVE the idea. Did you know that the client already has a template for this? The buy/sell coins template actually will track the price of the coin in fiat by converting to btc and usd. You can set your preferred funding method and can let it automatically track market prices. It was intended for low volume. Think of it like a decentralized \"local bitcoin\" without the need for a middleman and trustless Decentralized exchange was promised to Blackcoin. The NightTrader exchange was supposed to be based on deposits. Although they did not pay me, I want to finish that project as I like it. The problem and delay with it has really been choosing a protocol. There are 3-4 decent methods on how to do it which I can list below: \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 1) The original NightTrader concept of MICROTRADING: This method was basically to use Blackcoin as the deposits and trade 50% of the deposits over and over again until funding is reached in any two currencies. VERY similar to the Barter Template. Example Bob wants to but 5 btc of Bitbay from Alice 1 btc worth of Blackcoin is deposited both sides .5 btc of Bitbay is traded for .5 btc of Bitcoin 10 times Now 5 btc has been traded deposits are released \u00a0 This works with ANY two currencies and does not require any coin to fork. Thus is the perfect current solution There are DRAWBACKS though and here is some of them: Its too slow! Nobody wants to wait for 10 bitcoin transactions which could take days if network is slow It can bloat the blockchain if the Exchange is too popular (since there is more transactions) If the price of Blackcoin goes too low during a trade it would be beneficial to blow up deposits Transacting with multiple people in the order book becomes annoying (think 10 contracts to fund a few btc) The following methods dont need to rely solely on Blackcoin or Xcoin but have their own drawbacks too 2) The next method is ATOMIC TRADING. This wonderful little trick is to use locktimes to put the solution to a hash problem in your transaction so that it unlocks another transaction. Both parties use separate locktimes so they can redeem their funds if the corresponding locks arent sent. Advantages over microtrading: You dont need more than one transaction You dont need to involve 3 currencies Disadvantages: Its still a little slow, Bob and Alice need to give lots of time in case of power outages plus they still need to wait for several confirmations Checklocktimeverify is NOT in more than a few coins Blackcoin Bitbay Shadowcash Peter Todds coin etc I dont even think Bitcoin has locktimes 3) The next method is Multisignature exchange its CENTRALIZED but many times more SECURE than normal exchanges This was one of the serious candidates for NT exchange but it doesn't really rely on BLK it just uses the name NT The way it works is simple: The exchange holds a 2nd key to ALL accounts To perform trades the exchange uses signature hashes like SIGHASH NONE or SIGHASH SINGLE to have users sign only the coins they intend on trading as a Blank Check To secure the blank check the exchange puts in a small nominal amount of coins like 5500 satoshis Then the exchange is free to do very fast exchanging in the form of IOUS and only on withdraw do you pay the people you owe. Because the exchange is only 50% holder of the account, they can not steal funds without your key. Advantages: thousands of times more secure and better than a regular exchange almost trustless but not quite (see below) a lot faster than the concepts above Disadvantages: If a hacker somehow got all the servers keys they could try to find out which private key corresponded to their multisignature address. Then they can withdraw renegging on their IOUS. However the above attack only steals the amount of coins they traded. But if they were a whale this could still be devastating. Its will be hard for them to time double spending though. Also, if the exchange wanted to be evil they could sign IOUS to the wrong addresses taking funds Also, the exchange could pretend to be a user and make trades and still take funds Also, the exchange could lose their keys in a fire or HD crash and any coin without locktimes will lose their funds so the exchange would have to have a way of backing up their orderbook and keys on paper The biggest disadvantage is LIABILITY. Because its not decentralized there is much responsibility even if no hack occurs 4) The last and best way for decentralized exchange is the LIGHTNING NETWORK and P2P MICROTRADING This is a newer idea of mine. Its basically forming a Lightning network in each coin and microtrading between neighbors until the needed amount is reached. Because a lightning network does not report to the blockchain, they can fund using the most trivial amounts. How does this work? Accuonts are daisy chained Bob->Alice, Alice->John, John->Frank For Bob to send to Frank he routes his debt through Alice and John It can also be daisy chained with servers and withdraw tricks Bob->Server Server->Alice Advantages: Its probably the best way to do decentralized exchange Lightning networks completely reduce bloat on blockchains There are other advantages Drawbacks: Since they have to include multiple peers and possibly multiple servers, there could be some latency but its not much maybe a few seconds at the most. It requires that all coins have checklocktimeverify and its own lightning network Its too much work to get it done really well. SO thats the whole thing. Blackcoins NT will still probably get made with microtrading despite being not as good as AT or Lightning. Its decentralized and thats what i like about it. I'm willing to sacrifice speed for security any day. But it may not be popular since traders will want speed. And it does bloat the blockchain with smaller transactions and peers must stay connected for a few days to finish some larger trades. Also they will need Blackcoin and the deposit levels adds an extra amount of complexity to the exchange. The orderbook can be centralized to help a little with speed. IF there are trolls we can require a BURN for trades. Hope that helps! How do I contact Poloniex owner Directly?!"

I mean without the things you made for blackcoin already it would be a great POS coin but nothing really other than that now. The community isn't as it was and I wonder if it have reason to hold the MC it does now. So annoying to see all these coins raising a fortune in ICO and we have one of the best coders with the best concepts working for nothing because you/we got robbed at the start. However, like you say, perhaps even funds are not enough since how ever much btc we have ... only certain persons could help you build it and locating them seems near on impossible.

        "Had some time to think about this and just want to give my thoughts on the matter. 1st question: What does the Blackcoin community think about the potential of bloating the Blackcoin blockchain?  2nd question: Even if they agree it's no big deal now, but change their mind in the future, wouldn't that render all the Microtrading coding useless, and require a new system similar to the other 3 you mentioned to be coded? 3rd question: Let's keep in mind also that of all 4 options, which ones are most capable of expansion?  \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 My humble guess would be the atomic trading and lightning networks. Or even possibly an atomic trading system that evolves into a lightning network over time. So let's say in theory, you go with the AT build and left it at that; as the exchange grows you \u00a0or other coders work on expansion of AT and gradually enter/combine into a lightning network.  Advantages: You have a code that has no potential for abandonment due to bloating thus voiding the need for a blackcoin deposit. You create demand for other coins to get off their arse and actually code something \u00a0  - in this case checklocktimeverify. All the while bagholders are bitching at their 'make-believe' dev's of worthless coins, creating mass panic and volatility on exchanges ( \u00a0that's always fun \u00a0  \u00a0). This volatility brings in even more money as pumper groups try to rush buy the next new coin with CLTV creating more attention for cryptocurrency on a global scale. These noobs see crypto as a crazy volatile pile of madness except BitBay because it's powered by UVP peg technology. Yet this creates \u00a0a big enough demand that someone creates a simplified open source CLTV program that dev's can finally just copy and paste ( \u00a0all in a days work \u00a0  \u00a0). \u00a0 And the rush for CLTV coins causes NightTrader to gain volume and attention at a exponential rate. All the while you are sipping on a Corona on some beach in the Caribbean! Disadvantages: Bitcoin doesn't incorporate CLTV until 10 years later when the bitcoin foundation finally decides it might be a good thing to include. Other than that - none!"

        "It sort of bloats every blockchain. In fact, it won't bloat Blackcoins Blockchain since they are only used for deposit. I guess we can say they are the only ones who wouldn't get bloated. But its not so bad, its just we do 10-20 times the size of a normal transaction. Only if it was insanely popular would it start to show in the networks of coins. A new system is needed but nobody supports it. If Bitcoin doesn't have locktimes and other coins dont then only centralized solutions work That is, centralized or NT protocol. The microtrading is the best way, but you know since someone holds that second key its a liability.  (running an exchange is asking for trouble EVENTUALLY by state regulators, if its not decentralized its not worth the money perhaps?) AT and Lightning don't share anything in common despite both needing lock times. The protocol is so much different. Lightning is the only true way to do it if they all had AT. But lots of coins would have to want to do it. Maybe there is even some weird sidechain implementation for decentralized exchange but i cant think of anything off the top of my head that would make sense. If its not simple then it probably doesn't work. Until sidechains are even proven secure (I believe there was some sort of issue with 51% attack on Bitcoin and messing up sidechains) and there is other coins trying to get them right, so this is all hypothetical. Sidechains are over hyped. Besides don't we risk security by moving to one? I do like Lisks thing but it all needs to be validated as secure first For now, Blackcoins microtrader is the best way to do it. And besides, bloat is an issue EVERY coin will face soon enough Lets just say, it doesn't bloat the chain too much. Not any more than does Bitcoin gambling and nowhere near Etheriums bloat.

It basically consisted of signing a Contributor License Agreement, submitting a PR to the Azure templates Github repo, and sending them a write-up. Took us like 3 or 4 hours:) All the altcoins saying that Microsoft is \"partnering\" with them are being disingenuous - you are a partner inasmuch as you have a BizSpark account and signed a CLA. The upshot of this, however, is that developers that are already using Azure can build applications on top of the Monero blockchain, and are able to spin nodes up quickly and easily.\""

It a simple design either way. The pegging is not as involved as David's design because it is not intended to be, recently I have made it so that it is also decentralized now as anyone can stand up their own \"alias pegs\" and merchants can choose who they wish to use as the pegging (price tracking)... what else is a peg supposed to be used for in a marketplace?

        "Either way its a healthy debate. We don't have the money to market it, you are right. And maybe we never will but somebody had to make DDE based markets. Think of it this way, Napster was a P2P music sharing platform and it was the \"first\" and eventually failed. BUT Napster paved the way for newer and better platforms. You know, Kazaa came next, then E-Mule, then eventually uTorrent. Haha we grew up with this stuff  I really admire and respect what you do at sys! The fact that we have such different business models in my opinion doesn't really qualify us as competitors. And even if we were, this is all open source so I hope you and other projects take ideas as you need them. If we are all about decentralization then eventually crypto can go beyond \"X Coin, Y Coin, Z Coin\" So all the good tech will get integrated into the projects that care enough to build it out. Your project clearly qualifies as one of them. I've said it before and will say again. As long as the idea of DDE survives, I've done my job. Society needs to evolve like you said... 1st they need to understand what bitcoin even is 2nd they need to actually USE bitcoin instead of gamble on it 3rd they need to start caring about using platforms that are resistant to theft and DDOS 4th they would have to start looking at altcoins 5th they would need to use altcoins 6th they would then use a trusted escrow (syscoin) 7th they would realize the power of two party escrow/DDE/Nash Equilibrium/Ultimatum Game/etc Society has a lot of growing to do. And honestly there is like 50 more steps missing from that ladder. Because in order for them to go to trustless tech, they need to lose trust in escrow/merchants/governments I've pretty much lost trust in REALITY hahaha so it made sense that I would go and make something like this. LOOK at how Mt Gox, Mintpal, BTER, etc etc... EVERY place that was centralized or had an escrow went down ALL of them. And what do people do? They come back for more punishment! Still no decentralized exchange! So it will take some time for people to finally decide that trustless is better until humanity matures enough to stop telling lies. Hopefully the peg will draw enough attention that people will market it for us. And we are easily months away from that. By the way, you are adding a pegging system? Is this a voluntary parking system using checklocktimeverify? Or is it something more exotic?"

You posted a link that I assume was ment to be your justification of using the term pegging for your pricetracking in sys. I'll just post the definition you find there as well: Definition When the price of a security, commodity, or currency is fixed at a certain amount either by agreement, or intervention in the market. This is commonly used to stabilize or fix currency exchange rates, for example many international currencies are pegged to the U.S. dollar. Securities price pegging is however illegal, and regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission. You understood the words, but completely missed the context. Commodities in this context is not an iphone or a camera. We are talking oil, grain, etc. If I where to make a definition from the top of my head I would say that a commodity is not a commodity in the above context unless it is big enough to base derivatives on it. So we are back to what I told you before. Pegging is a term that is used in a macro enviroment. (Big commodities like oil actually are like currencies in some ways) I share your concern that confusion about features should be avoided, and that's why I'm so opposed to your use of the term pegging."

Since we all want to move towards decentralization and crypto currency stability, pegging BitBay to SDRs it's way more stable and positive for everyone, in the fiat world this is the best you can get, and if you are going to peg BitBay to something why not to peg it to the best\u00a0 currency? Please note that pegging Bitbay to the USD comes with financial and geopolitical risk  related to the U.S.A. However, if you peg BitBay to SDRs you reduce this risk by a lot.

Seems crazy to stick around and do 100% dev work and marketing for 20% of an ICO that turned into a scam. I'm also not sure why the other people are not in jail. Why david is making nightrader for blackcoin who didn't pay him again who knows. Seems to be the kind of guy that once he says he will do something he just seems to do it regardless. The coding behind this is better and has \u00a0more to offer than 99% of coins. I like the idea and will support the project. I buy some here and there on dips. If you are looking at it purely for speculation then if you can show me a better bet atm I would be interested. Not even 400k cmc. Wasn't even 200k cmc a few weeks back. Look at the lot of the junk in the 20-90 list. How half of that is there is crazy. When finished and if all goes to plan then if this is not a top 10-20 coin that would be rather strange.

Not ones where they have left taking the funds. I think polo may come round it bitbay starts to get 100BTC volume days. Right now polo does not need any other coins with ethereums daily volume. If it lasts then they are set up just from that coin. Ideally we would not need centralised exchanges. However, for now would be nice to have others as well as bittrex (although they are good). BTC38 could be useful again they add very very few coins though. I'm not sure why because they must be missing out on a fortune looking at the selection they have there. It may be worth getting on yobit. Although it is very small a lot of people do keep their eyes on it and there are few coins there with any volume.  The project mostly suffers from people not knowing about it. If you get more people looking at it at it's current value you will get more buyers and hodlers. Needs more marketing. Nobody currently involved with the coin needs fear the history of this coin. In fact it is a testiment to the project and community anyone is left here. Yeah it was a huge scam. It's been dumped down to 10 sats by the scum who gave themselves 100M coins to dump and took the BTC. Anyone left from the start needs a medal not to be told how terrible the coin is. Like telling a rape victim that it's her fault and punishing her further. I see many of the top developers congratulating david for sticking to it.

Also, after reading the thread and looking into the history of this project, it appears to me that the dev has a considerable amount of passion and persistence to deliver, single handedly, what was first originally promised to the investors of the project. It is clear that he has immense integrity and will finish what he started. If one single man can produce work of this quality equalling the same size of project as SYS, maybe better (time will tell), then I have every confidence that this project will be a success.  This is why I'm investing, and I believe others are beginning to see the potential in this project. It is highly undervalued.

Can't seem to get jpegs to work with it.  But yea...  You should be able to right click on the image at top of page. Click on \"save as\" Save that file to your computer (should be in .png format) Then use the Client's Key to Image feature.  Once clicked on... It will ask what image you wish to use to add a file to OR what image you wish to open It will detect automatically if you already have a file in the image - that's how it knows to skip the 'add setup' - and loads it up. In the window that asks you which file to load up (or add to), you won't be able to see it because the default file setting it's searching for are key files. These files have the suffix \u00a0 \u00a0\".private\" If an image has a zip file in it (for example and in this case), you simply need to select the different choice of file type at the bottom of this key to image window from \".private\" to \"All Files *.*\" Might sound complex but it's not really.  Once you select on that file option, you should see the image you downloaded from this thread as an option to load up. unzip the file and now you have 2 key files you can use to \"Open\" an account in the client. As always, first backup your existing account if you have one already set up. Once the these keys are opened up just click on the rescan option at the bottom of the Client's home tab to verify the account balance. Let me know if you have any issues."

        "So I just realized another potential for the steganography built into the client. We could essentially use it inside Ebay, etsy, alibaba, etc., to help merchants create an alternative payment method.  It would be sort of like an 'underground railroad' system. If they want to sell a camera. They could post an image with the camera on ebay. But it would have the hidden file inside with instructions to the buyer on how to contact the merchant via bitbay! Buyers who know about bitbay could scan the image for a file.  Once ebay, alibaba, etsy, etc., catch on, if they penalize the merchant, then they would do nothing but draw attention to the fact. This would be better than the best marketing tool money could buy, because it would be free! Next thing you know you'd have news articles all over the internet abuzz about this new trick to bypass the middleman and their fees! Next thing you'd see would be a mass exodus from these marketplaces to BitBay There are thousands of items posted each day. The resources for these companies to scan through pictures would be virtually impossible without adding expenses."

On this release at the end of month, will the bootstrap be programmed into the client installation file? Or will we still need to install it manually? If manually, what about in the future? I mean will it ever be built into the installation file or always manual. I remember installing the bitcoin qt wallet about 6 months ago; the bootstrap was automatic and I had the entire bitcoin blockchain downloaded in about 6 hours. That's pretty impressive to say for bitcoin's chain and very noob friendly. If I was completely new to crypto and realized I had to wait 2-3 weeks for bitcoin to sync, it would be a huge turn off. IMHO, since the rest of the new templates will be released on random intervals over the next few months, it would be a nice bonus to have the bootstrap automated for the sake of new users and at each new released template we could simply update the bootstrap along with them.

Mac 32 was a hassle since so many things arent supported for whatever license issues or who knows. Linux 32 and 64 bit builds now work, everything should work on many platforms (we have tested wheezy debian ubuntu and jessie) So for now I've only got one more to finish we should still have the by the 30th although packaging them is a little bit of work. This build will not come with the new template however it has tons of fixes and most importantly opens our user base. The coding of the template should come with much more ease after that. It also looks like multisignature staking will require a fork to POS 3.0 I'm trying to understand block signing a bit better, but it seems like we will just fork eventually. Since Cold Staking requires an extra output to 6a with the  block sign key (unless I'm not doing it correctly or there is an error in the source)... in that case I would need another way to sign the block or just wait or fix it which might be a distraction. Too bad since staking generates more coins in POS 2.0 For now, I can test this in BlackHalo however since I hold less coins there live testing is a lot slower (an hour to find a block) Will do those live tests today or tomorrow and finish the Mac 64 bit build. Lastly I need to make myself building scripts so I'm not making 15 different builds (BitHalo BlackHalo BitBay for all 5 platforms 3 times for each build!) I've already got a windows script which I made last month for faster building. However, running at least 4 VMs these other ones take longer. So we are on schedule! Give or take a couple days. And after this template work will be easier since there will be less distractions unless we encounter new bugs with Linux/Mac distros(hopefully its all good)."

        "Hey David, With the rolling peg system in place, I have a feeling a lot of volume will come from investors hedging from the volatility of other crypto, especially BTC. When python contracts are incorporated into the client, wouldn't they be able to create a whole new avenue for investors to create automated trading inside the client? So for example if an investor had a stop loss on BTC at 455.00, if the price hit that level, with python, he could essentially have created an automated order that would scan the client's market (with your price tracking feature) for the lowest priced sell orders (in Bays) and automate a trade with that contract when his stop loss alarm hit? For the fastest potential contracts you could have sellers and buyers on the client that also have automated contracts wishing to buy BTC, LTC, etc., or sell BAY for BTC, LTC, etc., thus the programs would find each other to maximize efficiency of the negotiation stages of the contract.  You and I finished one the other day in 10 minutes. And heck you said you already know a way to speed up bitmessage for a quicker network. And the same concept could be used with a take profit program or trail stop program And of course this could be said for any crypto coin an investors are trading in with an active liquid market on the client. Am I right on this concept?"

You can't use 3rd parties since they can steal the escrow. Also, they have no way of deciding who is lying in a dispute and are forced to guess. The markets we have here are tested for over a year now, there is almost no bugs we are pretty much at release candidate. Aside from just markets Halo itself has like 20 different features. OB doesn't do anything other than markets. There is templates like the cash for coins with price tracking. And lastly there has been a reputation system that has been working for a while now. So lots of advantages, now its just a matter of expanding and marketing. Plus, I've got lots of work to do with NT and the remaining templates/pegging."

Actually that post was more against the outrageous claims made by BitSquare and their omission of Halo. By the way, be careful with TOR and Bitcoin, it makes you less anonymous. Commenters say its only possible in theory but the fud comes from both sides. I think its logical to correlate IP addresses on Tor to a Bitcoin network. In fact, maybe even bitmessage runs similar risk. However in bitmessage, you dont know who is the originator of a message, since everyone passes it around."

Some people even think the attack is theoretical. But you can actually set Tor yourself in Bitcoin by adding it to the config file. In this next version I'm thinking of adding Tor support or proxy for outbound internet requests. Because right now, my client makes requests to google, davtonia, coinmarketcap and other servers The reason im thinking of adding some of settings menu now is because I want to add cold staking. I was gonna wait for the templates to finish first but maybe its okay to do some settings now and the rest later. The cold staking is good news for us and blackcoin. We wont be able to use cold staking until we fork. And I don't think we can use checklocktimeverify until we fork either. I've never done a fork so I need to also learn how to do one  Plus if i do cold staking now, then I might consider doing checklocktimeverify support in the gui. Because in the \"advanced sending\" tab I've got multiple payees options. So locktime might go there. And then im also thinking of multiple payors as a two step send! This would be useful for sending to a joint account because currently we have joint account support for no way for synchronous funding! Of course you can sync fund with a smart contract by why go through the trouble we you only need to leverage 2 step send. Its funny because if I had those two features, then a person could make a double deposit escrow without even using contract templates!"

However, the guys at slack felt that it was last minute for big marketing push so we are changing our approach to coding deadlines vs marketing deadlines. This build does not have the next template but it does have major performance updates and the 3 platforms we so badly needed. I'm extremely happy with these builds. Now we will work on almost all mac and linux. And with any exceptions I have building source we can link to with automated building scripts! Finally I'm extremely relieved to be able to get back on those platforms after a delay of at least 6 months. Since we got the builds last minute around the 1st of the month, we should have links up shortly. I will definitely want Mac and Linux testers, there will be a small push for testers in blackcoin and bitcoin as well to speed this up. (waiting for their site to be updated as well) So now, github is updated, ive got 5 building environments set up at home with lots of scripts and automation... still need to automate my builds a bit more but its getting very nice. Plus we have dominated every bug on the list. Special thanks to the members who helped me test. Thank you so much. Future deadlines will decouple my coding deadline with the marketing deadline so we always get builds with 2 weeks lead time to market them. With build in hand. But I will always set separate coding deadlines. This one month deadline proved to be accurate give or take a few days. I'm going to wait for the core slack team to update the links and post their announcements and feedback on this. So just keep posted for that in the next day or two."

For now, this update will include a final version of the Windows client and beta version for the Mac and Linux clients. For official downloads of the new client, please visit our website,   or in the OP of this thread. You can also build the bitbay deamon yourself by going to our new github source:   Note: That is the deamon only, not the whole client. We are asking help from the community with testing out the new OS beta versions. Bug bounties will be provided and David will greatly appreciate the effort. Please post any bugs found either on BCT or our Slack \u0093Client\u0094 channel to claim your bounty. To further entice volunteers we will provide treasure hunts that will require using the clients many features to find and unlock hidden faucets on the marketplace. David\u0092s been working hard at creating a client compatible with Mac 32 and 62 builds. The Linux 32 and 64 builds have been working like a charm in testing. We have been trying our best to find any bugs in the windows version - so far we\u0092ve only found some minor issues that have been easy to fix (posted on our Slack \u0093Client\u0094 channel), thus we feel very comfortable to announce a final version of the Windows client at this time. We will post our first treasure hunt on both BCT and Slack after the release of the new versions. So stick around\u0085 many exciting things to come with BitBay. Feel free to join us on slack:"

I mean from what little I can understand it certainly seems Bitbay is going to scale better and not require 10000tb hard drives to hold the blockchain etc. I keep seeing sys vs bitbay debates. There is one running on the main forum now. As yet the sys devs have not shown up but I'm sure they will given time. I guess no need to up the anti yet but there is only so long bitbay can remain passive in the face of copycats claiming superiority especially if that is not justified. I like both projects but really if bitbay is clearly superior this should become common knowledge to people at some point."

        "As you know I support other developers in their quest, its hard work!! With that said, I don't think I've been shy to say that double deposit escrow is a absolutely superior technology in every way shape and form!! Not to mention, this software is 50k lines of totally original code and 2 years in the making. There is also many more features like automated joint accounts, live translations, templates, price tracking bots, live price feeds, counter-offer systems, accounting, change management systems, p2m, imap and bitmessage, steganography, advanced sending, reputation system, etc. Dude the list is so long I probably forgot most of the things it does under the hood. The contracts aren't blockchain based so it doesn't add to the stress on the payment protocol. People need to remember that Bitcoin is a payment protocol FIRST not second! So it is in my opinion a horrible idea to conflate. Adding things to the blockchain that belong as separate protocols especially since contracts can and should be done peer to peer. Why force the whole blockchain to know you are selling your 1950s coin collection?! They don't care and it doesnt effect the outcome of the payment in the slightest. Do we really need to notarize everything? No! We notarize houses, yachts, stocks, things of great value. Now I'm not entirely sure about the full details of sys and its blockchain, I know they use links to images so thats good. But still links should not be on a blockchain either. However I hope the increasing of 6a is a temporary solution and that there is a long term plan to not make the markets blockchain based. I see this as a \"convenient place to communicate\". But just because its convenient doesn't mean its the correct way to do things. We discussed bloat recently, it was interesting to hear some of his methods of attempting to tackle the issue. The thing of it is, Bitcoin already has a bloat problem... which has yet to be solved. Bitcoin is a payment system, a bank. Its not a place to store everything. My software was around before Etherium was even announced!! That shows you how long I've been working on this. It is completely unfair to compare seasoned software with new software. I think the media has totally censored Halo in Lieu of Etherium which has been so much hype. They are a money vacuum, sucking up funds and resources. The media puts all their eggs in one basket forgetting that there is other ways to manage a blockchain. Blockchains arent powered by unicorns and rainbows... Etherium has scaling issues that go complete ignored. They may solve it, but even if they do, double deposit will always have scope well beyond \"decentralized markets\". It permeates all agreement and in my opinion deserves much more attention. You can do double deposit on any coin, this software was designed to accommodate that without lock times. Of course the media may end up censoring Halo anyways because it cuts out middle men. And they are the middle men. By the way, I realize that entertaining \"comparisons\" of protocols is just asking for a debate. I'm not interested in criticizing other projects including Ethereum. They probably do great things there. The reason we have the tech we do in Bitbay is because I believe its the best way. And of course its still the only smart contracting software in the world. Can you name another smart contracting software? Anyways, all these coins especially Sys, have my full respect. Even Eth. Their work is hard... people seem to be thinking this is a competition. I'm not here competing with other coins. I'm just making the tech that I know in my heart is the best. I've never seen this as a competition, but a tech breeding ground. We can't force people to use it, but if we market it hard enough they will use it. You should also remember I came to this party for double deposit. Thats why I got into crypto. That hasn't changed. Of course double deposit is the best way to do things. How many people have stopped to think about how backwards the legal system really is? We are literally living in a giant asylum. Double deposit could change that, bring people back to the hand shake deal. This software BitHalo BlackHalo BitBay should have been on the damn cover of Forbes! It should be in Times magazine. But you have to realize the media is the gatekeepers and technology that seeks to eliminate middle men won't necessarily get the warmest reception. Regardless, Bitbay increases your profit margins since you pay no fees to escrow. So the only thing lacking is media attention. And i think its naive to base faith in the technology of something just because it pumps or not. Does Dogecoin have better technology than Bitbay? Just sayin..."

        "Hey thanks for the input, the guys made the chart back a few days ago and shared it on slack, the community does their own thing at times albeit the decentralized nature of managing a project like this. Hope you don't mind, I think they made it based on the one you posted in the thread they made. I can state that there is moderation keys in Bay for banning everything from IP, to unique IDS, to encrypted IP address banning (I don't share my decrypt key but there is one) Removing entire markets is possible but they are easy to start as they are to remove. However putting moderation layer side by side would make sense. Since we both have one. There are two mod keys in Bitbay transforming the client to mod version. Bitbay will roll forward Bitcoin core improvements if Blackcoin does. I did see some core staging on rat4s branch. However, you might be more on the ball with that as I tend to ignore the c++ side of things. Bitbay doesn't re-use public keys for Bitcoin addresses. HOWEVER, BitHalo and BlackHalo and Bitbay can all use the same keys. And they are multisig. So switching from one account to another is trivial. Paying in BTC for items is easy, as it can be specified in the contract. That would be more conducive to a barter contract although Sys UI is clearly different and made to encourage the BTC payment alternatives where Bitbay is strictly encouraging Bay. Unless I add BitBay to BitHalo... which might happen if the pegging goes well and volume picks up. People might use BB over BH anyways because of the stability in pegs and price growth. That is sort of an unknown. As for your block market and bidirectional gateways and e-commerce plugins we definitely don't have that and I will probably never have the time to add that. So thats definitely something Sys has. I remember when you used to talk about that. It was cool and I'm glad to see someone has been doing that."

        "To add to this Sid, if you ever need some ideas to borrow for your client let me know(I would love to borrow from other projects but I'm up to my neck in coding work and have had to turn down a lot of work just to finish what I've got on my plate). Its in python but I can explain how I approached solving certain things. For example, PyQT has a \"translate\" option that it automatically puts in the UI when you build it from QT designer. Although those UI files can get fairly huge, and very redundant (Designer just makes the UI from a script but the code can be condensed at least 50% with a few days of work). I wasn't able to figure out how translate was anything automatically but manually from a strings database. Which we obviously did not have funds for. SO, I redefined the translate function to pull from a translations file. The file translates LIVE off Google translate as the UI loads text. This meant that I had to change the Dialog Boxes to be a custom Question Box in my main Halo source so it also used my Google translator. The last step was simply adding a simple UI for editing the translations... so that users can correct them and submit their corrections! The result? 92 languages for all Halo products. If you ever do translations, I recommend that approach and yet, I've never seen any software ever use that (what I thought was) simple step. Also, steganography can be done with the Stepic library. I'm sure c++ also has it. Just remember to use Bitmaps or PNG as Jpeg gets recompressed a lot. If you are emailing the images, only use Bitmap for Base58 And hopefully eventually you will add DDE with CLTV as an option. Not to give you a bigger work load, as scope creep is a bitch that can kill a project, but I personally think its worth it. Like sirlose said, there are other features... I even recently just added a live debugger which allows me to put \"exec\" statements and use the python interpreter as the code runs. An easy but useful addition for troubleshooting. Only for coders or advanced users but you can definitely use it to communicate the the blockchain too if you know the source."

But I don't want to sound like I'm excluding Windows users! So if you are simply lurking and don't have any BitBays, that doesn't mean you can't test the system. I currently have \u00a0a BitBay faucet in place in the form of a guarantor contract. Guarantor contracts are designed so new users can buy Bay's (or any currency for that matter) without the need for the buyer to deposit anything in escrow.  So the current faucet on the marketplace is obviously completely free - 1000 coins per user and limited to 1 contract per user. So if you haven't already downloaded the client, you can do so at bitbay.market or this thread's OP. The faucet is the perfect opportunity for you to learn how the contract process works. If you have any issues when we are in contract, I can chat with you though the bitmessage encrypted escrow negotiation/messaging box.  Looking forward to seeing you in the marketplace!"

        "Dapps are mostly hype. For what reason does an application need to be on a blockchain? The whole idea that \"everything needs to be on a blockchain\" is totally ridiculous. I guess when your solution is a hammer, every problem looks like a nail. Blockchains are for notary and banking and hashing almost exclusively. Apps function fine without existing on a chain and to put apps on a chain only bloats it. Which is why the whole thing with Etherium is just a cash grab and I refuse to support that level of hype and greed. Regardless of whatever progress they make. Even if they do develop into a good platform, there will be tremendous bloat issues that can only be solved by centralization. Because they are putting too much on the blockchain. And they know it. Lisk has a better approach of sidechains. But why would Bitbay be a sidechain of Lisk? That doesn't make any sense. Bitbay already exists, what would this accomplish? Except make us look weak. You still need a blockchain to store value, what difference does it make if its a sidechain? Again, more techno-babble to confuse the masses and take their money. Sidechains may suffer from less nodes or more regulation from the parent chain. Sidechains really only are needed for business applications where the user puts risk in the chain because the chances are is the sidechain would be centralized or with fewer peers. So in that sense I support Lisk and similar concepts to move the risk off the miners and on to end users. Also, why degrade this project to be some arm of Etherium which has not only proven itself to be driven by greed, and immense speculation but vaporware mostly considering they are overpromising tech to dazzle the masses. Then repackaging that tech as a dapp and fundraising again. It almosts makes me think that modern business is ONLY about marketing. Or perhaps we should start \"governmentcoin\" where everyone can be on one blockchain that is government regulated and your taxes are automatically taken out and you social security is replaced with a private key and they can deactivate your key if you break one of the 10 million laws they have. I dont know, please excuse my comment but Dapps are not the future. Decentralized banking is. In any case, thanks for your kind words, although it might seem like an art, the technology used to do what we do is very complex and requires a lot of work. Much like the engine of a car."

The masses do not see how crypto benefits them (YET) However there is a hope here that the masses will eventually notice crypto and when they do, it won't be about \"Dogecoin\" or \"Kittycoin\", it will be about what can they do with the software and technology. Most of the people involved in BitBay are early, they know what is being worked on. The key is to help other investors also understand what is going on here and this might be achieved by marketing and finding people who also see the ideology in the project. As we know, the masses are usually not motivated by ideology so for the rest there is only marketing. Which in the case here might come in phases as the software continues to release more features.

        "Azure is acting like a gatekeeper. You can see subtle maneuvering in crypto for sure. I'm not saying Dapps aren't good but I'm saying the method in which decentralized applications is deployed is not a trivial computer science problem. If it was that easy they would just start \"internetcoin\" where they put the entire internet on a blockchain. Which obviously doesn't make any sense. Etherium sandboxes their code, so does Lisk. Which is good in theory. They could attempt methods of compressing and hashing known bits of code on the chain but in the end there is a bloat issue. Who has this kind of bandwidth? It takes me a half an hour to download a 100 megabyte file. Granted my connection is not that fast but we have to find a peer to peer solution. (maybe a lightning network) In any case, the critical question remains: Blockchains are about store of funds and notary, what else truly belongs there? Sidechains are good in theory. But the reason in my opinion they work is because they remove the risk of running some obscure application that could lose your funds to the peers. So the peers might be able to take the risk instead of the miners and the entire network. And I'm not sure the best proposal has been put forward yet. Ethereum will be a good test ground for what does and doesn't work. Regardless, not everything can be on a blockchain because you can't download all of youtube to watch a single video, nor should you be forced to download an entire website to view a single page. Nor should that burden be placed on all peers to verify if you visited the webpage, clicked on a button and so forth. There is some fundamentals which Bitcoin is missing that Ethereum does have. For example, a better scripting system. Thats great and I think bitcoins scripting is very limiting. Things like lightning networks, pegging tools like we are doing here, sidechains and even pre-approved contracts(which ive yet to see any coin do)... are all good ideas. Tokens are interesting if you can get courts to honor the notary which i highly doubt. In any case these are complex computer science problems that are not solved by simply putting everything on a blockchain. Otherwise, there is simply hype for the sake of marketing a protocol. And then the protocol becomes less important that the marketing."

Feel free to accept it - 1000 free Bays. No coins are needed to accept because it's a guarantor contract and doesn't require DDE.  That's the beauty of the escrow system.  It's completely customizable:  \u00a0- The standard is Double Deposit Escrow that match the value of the item for sale. \u00a0- Guarantor contracts are one-sided deposit escrow contracts.The creator of the contract takes the 'majority' of the risk since the counterparty doesn't deposit anything. This set up is perfect for people who don't have any Bays and wish to buy direct through the client. It's recommended to KYC these customers and/or keep the contract size at minimum levels for the sake of security. \u00a0- Custom deposits give you the option to create your own levels both for you and your counterparty. If you don't trust them, jack their end up. If you trust them, lower to a minimum level you feel secure with. If you have complete trust you can void the deposit all together (yet to a level that meets anti-dust protocol for spam protection - this can be a one-sided deposit to cover)."

The part that I find ridiculous is the defense arguments of population or the numbers of USD in existence.\u00a0 Even if there were 500 billion people on the planet... there's still only a few thousand that hold BAY - so that's irrelevant. As far as the USD being a racket (which I would definitely agree with you on that) - can you really say other than 'potential' that crypto has   proven to be any different?\u00a0 \u00a0If you replaced 'coin devs' with 'federal reserve' - you'd once again have a group of people that have infinite spending power providing a 'widget' representing whatever value they grant to it, only as long as it is granted (and largely revocable at any time by them as well). I believe crypto in general has great potential for disrupting the established concepts of exchange and commerce... but especially for those that still hold IPO coins - it's pretty disingenuous to cavalierly disregard any statement of caution with \"but the USD is a scam and we're totally different\". At least I would add \"we   be different\" - only history will tell whether that is truly the case.\u00a0 Regardless, I'm delighted to see the massive amount of work that's being done in crypto in general and in the BAY/BLK circles specifically.\u00a0 I certainly don't mean to diminish the work and vision you and others have demonstrated in these regards, simply stating that we're miles from the finish line (and realistically not more than a few steps out of the gate).\u00a0 I just read far too much religious zealotry on coin pages too often and so little calm rationality in regards to the actual application and promotion of crypto.\u00a0 I was certainly drawn in by the concept and potential back in the early BTC days and it's that same thing that's kept me here (and in BLK) despite all the drama and scamming. One thing I have learned however, is that the best investments and trades I've made are always the ones made with skepticism and doubt and the disastrous ones are always those made on emotion and blind faith.\u00a0  I'd much rather bet on the 'dark horse' that BAY has become now than on the 'golden child' it was initially marketed as being... as it is, my optimism for BAY will always be somewhat dampened by the fact that I didn't act on my skepticism initially. To those who did, and are possibly coming back and considering investing in BAY now... I can see far, far less downside and an absolute crap-load of upside potential.\u00a0 For the rest of us it's a much less 'unbridled optimism' that drives our continued investment.    Cheers!"

        "Thanks really interesting post. One thing I want to remind everyone here of, we are not promoting Bay but existing software, nor are we pulling at anyones heart strings, or pushing an ideology(except for the occasional opinionated rant such as the one below, and DDE). Only things being done here is honoring the original agreement to work on the software and complete the tools in this coin as investors were told they would get. And hopefully extending this softwares influence and reach. And there is an ideology but not one that is being sold per se... and that ideology is making crypto independent. Allowing people to decentralize all aspects of crypto by promoting good ideas. DDE and Pegging. If crypto is to become a tool used for good then those two ideas must survive. Most importantly, DDE must survive. Pegging perhaps being the second most important crypto tool. Notary and smart contracts being the next most important. Actually I never would claim that Crypto was different from USD. As many people on here who have heard from me in the past, the reason I developed Halo was to protect people from Bitcoin. It was obvious that Bitcoin was a project that would soon lead to more loss of human rights. It was clearly made in a compartmentalized manner, reeks of government involvement. So we only chart our own course, because the tool itself was okay, the divergence is what we want to do with the tool. The destiny of crypto depends not on \"which coin will be successful\" but \"which IDEAS will be successful\". Just like a knife or a pen, it can be used in many ways good or bad or neutral. Thus, Halo has the capability to create 2 party contracts where a person could get off of (corrupt government coin) and get on a network that has the ability to form private agreements usurping totalitarian control. At least this was the motive. Another motive was the obvious fact that in an anarchy, only double deposit makes sense. Although a lot of people think anarchy would result in more crime people tend to forget that the media and almost every film that comes out is completely violent. In fact, oddly enough nudity in movies is censored and violence is not. Every single news piece is propaganda without exception. Almost never do I see \"feel good\" news anymore. At least in the early 90s, 1 out of 10 stories were feel good. Now its zero. So with that said, its probable that we are conditioned to think and be violent tacitly and fear loss of government. Which in truth only gives them full control of our minds. Something some of us will never accept. So with all the technology today, most of the best tech is hidden from the public, and yet decentralization flirts with the idea of a technological utopia of sorts where currencies are private, commodities are 3d printed (including for self defense) networks are meshed and food is grown in a decentralized futuristic way and so forth. This is why only the idea of DDE must survive. The whole purpose of commercializing this project. To prevent deception using deposits and eliminating third parites who have no business or time or justification to meddle in the affiars of others. Luckily and ironically, had it not been for Bob and the sabotage, I probably would never have proposed a pegging tool. Its original purpose was to simply protect investors from the bastards that started it. But after lots of discussions with colleagues and friends on slack, its clear that pegging is absolutely needed for crypto assets. In some ways, it opened my eyes to how important pegging really is. Notice how even projects like Tether get a consistent volume? Pegging is needed, required and its the only tech that GUARANTEES cryptos survival. This is perhaps exactly why crypto is permanently bullish. In fact, even crapcoins are bullish because of these technologies. Imagine, rolling pegs can make \"Truckcoin\" and \"Elephantcoin\" stabalize in value and even rise in value. And why not? Should a person not be allowed to work on a private project, seeking funding and creating value in their own project? If its an honest and motivated project, would their peers not invest in it? Does it really matter if they premined it? After all people invest in stocks that the board of directors hold almost always 51% favorable stocks. Investors get a mere nothing fraction of the company. Does anyone remember Enron? Or perhaps the obviously scandalous Facebook IPO. And yet, probably about 90% of the fortune 500 companies fix their stocks and prices. I bet some of the companies don't even exist. Much like some crypto assets. In the end the only thing that differentiates a good coin from a bad one is the HONESTY of the people creating it. Users or coins are too quick to speculate, trusting \"The DAO\" or other projects not realizing the probability of deceptions, buying their own coins, stealing bitcoins from the till and taking advantage of peoples trust. Who is to say the \"DAO\" didn't give themselves tokens to sell or buy their own tokens with the Eth they already had. This again is why DDE comes first, requiring deposits for trust. Forcing honesty among peers. Its IS TRUE that most crypto systems are in fact equally corrupt to federal dollars. However, the whole purpose of pegging would make this somewhat irrelevant. If prices can remain stable and consistently match volume and demand then private parties can issue their own cryptocurrencies. With pegging, its theoretically possible for a healthy market to sustain thousands of different coins, each one being healthy. And so a coin only needs to be popular since a user of a coin would only need to concern himself with wether or not its popular enough to resell it at the fair market value (which is of course pegged). Artificial price growth isn't even a bad thing with a rolling peg. If anything its good. A saavy investor would look at the project, its growth potential and popularity before investing in a coin that artificially grows its price. The one thing that is absolutely painfully obvious is, the worlds corruption comes not from the technology we have access to, but the hearts of men which cannot be changed. Thus the only true \"weapon of mass destruction\" in this world is propaganda, capable of shaping beliefs. If anyone finds a way to decentralize the media, that would be the best technology on earth. But how to prevent the voice of propaganda, false news, fake coins, fake devs from infiltrating anything? Dare I say fake math and fake science?! Do people even question what they learn in school? Why is material automatically accepted just because someone in a position of scientific authority deems the material to be honest and true? If I remember correctly, we learned astronomy in a book, we never were told to watch the sunset. We were not asked to question the material. We learned chemistry in a book. We were given tests where we were not allowed to question the test material. And forced to answer exactly what the books told us or fail the test?! We are not educated, we are TOLD. And by centralized sources at that. Almost nothing we were taught was true. In most cases, it turns out to be the opposite unfortunately. Real schools would teach construction, farming, electronics, alchemy, sports, social skills, botany, etc. And they wouldn't use books, but hands on experience, trial and error, scientific inquiry and experimentation and zero assumptions. School would be optional, but everyone would want to go because of how awesome it was. Kids would walk themselves to school in excitement, not in fear.  Kids are smarter than people give them credit for, in their hearts they KNOW school is corrupt/evil, they just aren't able to articulate why their instincts tells them its wrong. Because the material is wrong even deliberately. They know homework is wrong but parents force them to do it. People question how such a grandiose deception could take place but they overlook the 18 years of FORCED SCHOOLING. A student who gets straight \"A\" on all his tests, gets perfect grades in college, goes to Harvard is the perfect victim of deception. Because this student didn't even bother to question the material, no they memorized it by heart. The short answer is \"propaganda\" and \"belief propagation\". The greatest threat of all. The key here is, technology at its core is always good. Even the dollar in theory is good. Its only when people charge interest on money (usury) and when propaganda is used when an idea or theory is corrupted. Fake science, fake tech, vaporware etc. This is why DDE is so important. To give a way for us to change the paradigm, force honesty in a disingenous world. I'm not saying this will ever happen. In fact, from watching human behavior, I highly doubt it will ever get used. But this won't stop me from using my own technology in my personal life. It exists, it can be used despite the opinions of wether or not a pair of shoes should be worth 10,000 BAY or .017 BAY. And anyone here who ever wants to make a contract that is harder to break, they have the tool! In BitBay, BlackHalo and BitHalo. Consider this a rant, from a Don Quixote of sorts which may be referenced somewhere when the smoke clears. And who knows, perhaps people will get tired of being lied to and finally use the tech. A man can dream. Now get back to work Zimbeck!! This thing won't code itself."

It's an interesting and somewhat paradoxical cycle that man is constantly involved in: free will -> inspiration -> ambition -> corruption/greed -> domination -> rebellion -> conflict -> free will.\u00a0 The biggest issue is finding a cause/direction which fuels ambition but mitigates tendencies toward corruption and domination.\u00a0 These technologies may indeed be the first steps in providing a solution (at least as it pertains to commerce and resource allocation).\u00a0 Perhaps in time a similar technology will provide a decentralized media solution - we have a similar model in twitter/YouTube/Facebook/etc. combined with the mass adoption of phones capable of documenting events at any time from multiple perspectives.\u00a0 Unfortunately in it's current incarnation they are all little more than a tool for the ambition and greed of a few to exert a similar type of control and domination over the masses while presenting the facade of independence and free will. Keep up the good work and the rest will happen eventually - either that or we're heading for a massive 'reset' of everything and the survivors will have to pick up the fight!\u00a0 Hopefully not, but maybe so.

On the other hand, he is probably the most efficient dev in crypto. Most big dev teams have not been able to deliver a fraction of what David has coded all by himself.  I agree things move fast in crypto. To fast! Everyone seems to forget that we are working on software that is designed to handle peoples money. Thorough testing is a must, and can't be skipped or rushed. I tested the release version of the wallet from a competing coin, and immediately got my coins locked. Now we have the DAO situation. It's a good thing we have this sandbox we call the crypto community that allows experimentation and mishaps like that, but incidents like that are totally unacceptable when we want ordinary people to use it. There would be so many law suits, there would be no time for development anymore. We had the win version of our client in beta for more than a year, and I'm glad we did. We found the last bugs only weeks before we released the official release version. It is now rock solid. Mac and linux will stay in beta for a while to make sure there are no OS specific bugs. And when I talk about bugs I don't just mean obvious bugs. Considering that ordinary non tech people are supposed to use this, we have to treat every problem that users can create as a bug, or at the very least give them a warning when they do something that might lead them into trouble. Like not using default install path. There is no way to rush this, so when you say better innovation is coming from other directions I disagree. Ideas come cheap. Anyone can make a roadmap with some fancy innovations. But actually making the software, and then doing the tedious work of finding and removing bugs -that is a whole different beast. To my knowledge our client is the most advanced wallet in existence today, and so far we have only made the fundament. Now we will begin to roll out the exiting stuff..."

        "So David... Once the BitBay client is set up to stake. We can then also remind the exchanges that they could essentially create futures contracts. So lets say a coin holder deposits his Bays onto an exchange like bittrex or c-cex (screw the thieves @ bter). The exchange could then create different options for the trader to hold coins.  They could ask that the investor to lock their Bays in the exchange for: 1 week, 2 week, 1 month, 2 month, etc. These coins would be locked in their possession for the allotted time frame. The exchange would have 2 keys protecting the accounts. These locked coins would be merged into a larger groups of coins. The coin holders would gain incentives with these options because the grouped coins would have more stake reward potential. They could post these 'futures' contracts on their websites. Traders could tally the info thus creating speculation on price swings upon contracts fulfilling. The speculation would come from the option given to contract holders to either renew the contract or close out and recover stake reward. This speculation would cause investors to gamble on price during times of contract renewals. They might try to sell off before the 1 month contracts reach fulfillment thinking that the contract holders will be closing out and thus increasing liquidation on the market. Yet that's where the trickery comes into play. If the contract holders don't close out and renew instead, then speculators just sold at a potential loss and not a premium! The exchanges could also give contract holder renewals incentives. For example, if John enters a 1 month contract, upon fulfillment, he renews and earns an extra .5% earnings on the stake reward total. If he renews again add more, etc.  I know this influences people to leave their coins on a middleman exchange, yet with multisig technology. There should be a way to do this with minimal risk Thoughts?"

Also because I'm the only coder, when life gets in the way, it causes delays. Regardless, this month I'm back to coding full time. For example, Bitcoin has been working on the lightning network for years, companies such as 21 and others. Ideas that seem simple can prove to take lots of time to code. Also, in a perfect world I would love to start over from scratch with a team. Knowing what I know now about blockchains. It would be awesome to rewrite Bitcoin. There are so many ideas but it would only work if I wasn't the only coder. It's not a surprise that we are seeing the rise of centralized blockchain such as Steemit. And we will see many more in the next 10 years. As predicted. Yeah so this is why decentralized exchanges, side chains, notary, lightning networks and pegging systems are so crucial Altcoins have the advantage of testing faster, forking easier, and trying new ideas. The rolling peg is simple in theory however, it has tons of small features. The biggest challenge was finding a protocol that was decentralized and secure. The method chosen is really awesome. I want to write a paper on it, but some of the core members have advised me to wait before the release so it doesn't get used by the competition. It is tempting though. Also thanks to everyone who still follows this project. Thanks for your loyalty. It really helps drive the project forward."

So when people see that done and they hear progress on slack then the volume will pick up and it will be self evident. Smart investors are patient. Some may come in later, that's no big deal. Pushing it forward isn't needed (aka pumpers and market makers). That's the point of the rolling peg. Of course volume is awesome but the purpose of this code is to make the market maker irrelevant. In theory I could back it myself by deflating/freezing and then slowly unfreezing as volume increases. But sure when investors come in because they know it's almost done, cool.

Its built on Bitmessage, so its P2P and not blockchain based which makes it much more anonymous (arguably more than Tor) and doesn't have the issues of bloat. If you read up, you will see there is 20-30 more little features built in to Halo. I've been working on it for 3 years at least. It doesn't get the media attention ETH does because I'm working alone without a marketing team.

        "We make it even better.  Imagine if you have Dash or Monero (or any coin for that matter). In essence, you could use our marketplace to finally utilize your \"other\" coins in a safe trustless environment. Granted to remain trustless, it would require some BitBay, as BitBays are used for the double deposit escrow program - which enforces counterparties to be honest. But for example, let's say you hold a bag of monero, yet you typically only buy and sell items on Ebay for less than 100 dollars, then all you would need is 100 dollars worth of BitBay. Then you could create or join a \"Monero\" bitmessage backed marketplace (or Dash, Pinkcoin, Doge, etc...), and other monero holders could join that same marketplace channel and you can trade back and forth using your Monero as the coin of purchasing power and BitBay as the coin for transaction security. Again, finally... every crypto coin in existence has a way to trade their coins (or items for their coins) in a safe, secure, trustless environment. If you want a more private environment, you can simply create any marketplace you wish, for example, \"iUkiqFUsTciMsBdnYETgE2DMg4k3fMdP\" I'd say that's a name of a marketplace that no one will just randomly stumble upon if they are bored and trying to find other markets to join! Now with that marketplace created, you could post items for sell on it, then with the use of BitBay's client, you could email your potential customers the name of the marketplace. You can do this through the safety of the client with its Pay-to-email feature. BitBay's Pay-to-Email is powered by bitmessage protocol and security.  So in essence, you could send your clientele emails through the client, with minimal BitBay's (send them 1 BitBay for example - (mainly for transaction fees to miners)) and even password protect the email. So then you could utilize another means of communication to send them the password for them to open the email you sent - kind of like a 2FA feature. Once they open the email, they could see your marketplace you created, join it, and trade with you in Monero, Dash, etc., with the privacy of your choosing! The possibilities with BitBay are amazing! David's goal is to have everything complete before the end of the 1st qtr of next year."

People talk of these bitcoin coin-mixers that somehow wash you fingerprints off your stash (at a risk), \u00a0and it seems the debate over whether Dash or Monero are the anon kings is currently at an all time high of interest. My question is... with the decentralized, trustless, anonymous aspect bitmessage provides for BitBay's client, is there any other option we are possibly missing that could add even more anonymity to the client? With bitmessage and the bitbay client, wouldn't some sort of coin mixer be possible? Or is that something you plan to save for the Night Trader exchange? Or maybe you could better explain the potential possibilities with your upcoming release of a Tor setting built into the client? I mean correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't bitmessage already similar to a ring signature setup since no one can determine who the originator of the message is from inside the network?, so wouldn't the same go with the coins involved as well? \u00a0- Also, I didn't know if you've seen this link yet. It's from one of the head moderators at bitmessage forum:  There is all sorts of goodies inside. I never knew about binsend and bitcrypt. Seems like there would be lots of potential with binsend and your future programmable python smart contracts that are not secured by blockchain (due to not wanting to bloat the chain)? Would love some clarity on the matter as I'm not techie enough to completely understand all of the possibilities BitBay has to offer."

Plus to be anon just exchange coins on an exchange withdraw to a new address. Or use double deposit to trade cross chain. But still, sure I want more anon functions. Maybe we can use another coins anon feature when we finish. Also I doubt an anon feature would get a price rise. We have smart contracts and decentralized markets and still no price rise.

        "I've tried to read some of the posts, I can see that the developers are devoted to this project and are very keen on making it successful but one thing I noted here is that you guys don't talk about the marketing side of it, no matter how solid a project is if nobody is out there to use it the effort invested into it will not be rewarded. I read a post that the developer of Bitbay developed smart contract ahead of Ethereum but to me Ethereum guys get this right because they got marketing/publicity side of their project right and they become successful. I have no doubt there is a market gap for Bitbay to fill but we need to understand that marketing a product is a important as developing it if not more important."

        "Good question! Well first of all, if EBay adds Bitcoin we still offer a different advantage over them because we use unbreakable contracts using double deposit escrow. That's a huge advantage. Also Halo and Bitbay have the best wallet security of any coin. Since all accounts are multisig and you can pay using a cold wallet by using two computers to sign transactions and store your keys in images it's great for people who live in areas without trust. Realize in 3rd world countries they have no trust. Even packages get taken. However with double deposit they now have a way to trust each other regardless of if they live in a democracy, kingdom, dictatorship, or anarchy. This does require education and the only way that happens is exposing them to Bitbay. The good news is, Bitbay is the ONLY software that translates to 92 languages love in the software. So anyone can read instructions on how to use this programs, the smart contracts and the markets. The rest is simply marketing."

        "I might add that no centralized entity will ever become competition for BitBay (through duplication) because BitBay is a 'not-for-profit' protocol. Amazon, Ebay, Google, Etsy, etc... all have profit as their main source of motivation. This fact alone is a huge game changer and will never be trumped because it's simply not profitable to try and trump it! The last time I sold something on ebay I had to fork out almost 10% in fees to the company after selling my item; it was a $6,600.00 piece of camera equipment. Did I get a reduced fee for selling such a high dollar item - hell no! Ebay took over 600 dollars out of my paypal account.  With BitBay the merchants keep ALL the profit! The only fee involved with BitBay is the standard bitcoin protocol for a transaction fee that supports the miners that secure the blockchain - we are talking a fraction of a penny per dollar. And if you take in consideration that if you are staking your coins you are going to easily earn more BitBay than any transaction fee applied to your various items bought or sold. So it's actually more than free, it rewards you and pays you for supporting and investing in it."

We can prove price doesnt rise because of tech based on the fact that Blackcoin had contracts years before ETH and Bitbay had markets yeahs before OB. We have the best tech here. The current price of Bitbay is almost an insult lol. Ethereum may not be pumpers they might be theives. The DAO was completely wrong. ETH raised 20 million to code their client. They had no product was vaporware for a year and then they release buggy product with serious security holes and absolutely no user interface. Months later the UI was a joke. Then by Vitaliks own admission, they dumped their premined coins on the market. Then instead of coding, they try to be media darlings hyping up their product which bloats the blockchain with no prospective resolution. Plus, they overblow what contracts can do unlike DDE which has many real world applications. Of course DDE is only one type of contract but it's the most important. Then they involve themselves in another crowdfund(when they should have been coding) which they didn't market and somehow got 100 million. It was obvious they bought their own DAO and refunded themselves (no different from our scandal but times 100)... so like 20 plus million wasn't enough for these greedy fellows they wanted more. If I had 40 mil I could build a frikkin UFO lol. Then they audit the DAO, find a serious bug, and instead of TESTING the race to zero attack, they say \"it's no big deal\" and then allow the bug to happen. If that isn't an \"inside job\" then I don't know what is. They sold their coins pick them up for half and then dump again. Then they violate all principalities and ethics of blockchain and reverse the transaction... causing a fork, screwing the community, and most importantly not taking responsibility for their actions. I like Vitalik from our conversations and I hope he is innocent pawn. But the Ethereum team as a whole are theives... or at best completely irresponsible."

I suppose it's a matter of visually showing people what this software can do. Screenshots, videos etc. Articles as well help and I'm looking into that.

There are many coins with superior tech that aren't doing as well as they should but I think you may be focusing too much on bashing other coins such as Eth. I see the same being done by Vcash dev. That doesn't help your coin. What you are lacking is partnerships, marketing people and investors. Good tech alone won't help you go too far as we have seen with many coins before. The big shitcoin devs have people going into various conferences around the world and talking to people, forging partnerships and making deals. You are not doing any of that. That is why Bitbay isn't going much higher. Maybe you can't afford to go to conferences, but you can enter into partnerships.  Partnerships - Are there any authority people out there who would appreciate high end decentralized tech? You should do a video chat with them. Build the word slowly with the people who like this stuff. If they like it, they will talk about it in front of their audiences. These are the people looking for interesting content to share or they simply talk about you out of pure passion. You may consider doing interviews with anarchic talk shows, for example.  Marketing led by people - start a referral program where people can get paid in a decentralized way to promote various aspects of Bitbay such as getting new vendors and buyers. Website owners can then put up ads, tutorials, coupons of listings on the bitbay network and get paid in a decentralized way. Private group of investors - they aren't in for the passion alone. They want to make a profit. Consider the siafund method. A second chain or maybe a token (bayfunds) built on top of another chain which gets X% of the bitbay network fees as taxes. Your investors can own the bayfunds. Now they have an incentive to promote bitbay and increase bitbay network activity."

A faucet type contract has to be a guarantor type contract (other types require that the counterparty deposit Bay for escrow), so the creator of the contract takes all the risk - granted we are talking about a \u00a0minimal faucet style contract. But the point I'm trying to make is that the best way for you to deal with counterparties (so they don't cheat you on your app testing) would be to wait to accept their bid for the contract after you get the text message confirmation from them. That way you don't lock any coins in contract prematurely if they tried to scam you for your coins. If you were already in contract with them you'd still be able to bomb the contract (not send any coins to them) if they scammed you, but you'd be the one who loses your coins in escrow - hope that makes sense.  So the best way to protect yourself would be to wait until you receive text confirmation before you accept their bid for your contract and enter escrow. All of that is already included in the client, so no need to even worry about creating a programmable smart contract for it - granted with a custom programmed contract I'm sure you could add more \"bells and whistles\" to it, but that option won't be released for a couple more months. Hope this helps."

When that happens I'm sure we should be able to gather up some funding for a lucrative marketing campaign - hopefully advertising across multiple outlets which will create a positive domino effect. POW coins can't achieve this because they have to keep mining coins at a premium price all the while other miners gain interest and begin diluting the new found block rewards which then forces an increase in difficulty which is a whole different 'domino effect' for any sort of marketing campaign that relies on mining to support it's endeavors."

And since the peg will obviously bring stability, then a big pre-peg pump wouldn't turn right back into a dump.  So such a potential pump has never been witnessed before. Granted the actual initial peg value has yet to be determined yet so I don't know how that will play into the equation.  Yet I'd think any potential pump would have a big influence on determining the initial peg price. Again, it's unprecedented and therefore never been witnessed before - history in the making.

We will use the forum section on site more in the future though. Mostly for help topics because it's nice to not have to read through a ton of pages here to find answers. The rolling peg, as we call it, is a way to stabilize the value of Bay. We believe one of the obstacles for digital currencies is the volatility in price. Why would Alice and Bob start using a currency that can lose 20-50% of it's value in a day? Doesn't make sense. So we are coming with a solution to that. BitBay will be the first currency in the world with the ability to automatically regulate supply to meet demand at a target price. This is done by freezing/releasing Bay. It's basically the same thing that nations do when they increase or decrease money supply. It's just much easier to do because we don't have to factor in the effect on interest rates, unemployment etc. The peg is designed to be flexible. Meaning we are not targeting a fixed value of Bay versus USD that never changes. Price will be allowed to move, but the extreme pumps and dumps that we know from crypto will not be possible. Think of the peg as a way to make the price of Bay move similar to bluechip stocks instead of crypto. An added advantage of our peg is what we call UVP, user value protection. The following is a very schematic example of how that works. If you buy 1 bitcoin worth of anycoin and it drops 20% you will only have 0.8 bitcoin left if you are forced to sell. In BitBay this will be different after the peg is implemented. If you buy 1 bitcoin worth of Bay and it drops 20% that will result in coins being frozen to maintain value. 20% of your coins are now frozen, so you will still only get 0.8 bitcoin if you are forced to sell,   you still have 20% of your Bay. When demand picks up they will be released, and you can sell them."

Afaik the problem is 2 fold.. determining how far from current price the target price is and actually changing the supply.. getting the current price is easy on paper but presents some problems with hackers when trying to do it in a decentralized way.. in syscoin i read it from an alias thats published which cant be hacked but rely on centralization.. so to create a simple peg of any currency is as simple as creating an\u00a0 alias with peg information and rest of network gets it and cant screw around with the peg.... voting for it presents other problems which is thr act of changing the supply... so im interested to hear how these problems were solved in a decentralized method by david to avoid both of these problems."

        "Tether is literally just as simple as saying \"we back 100k coins with 100k USD\" I assume the increase in supply was due to increase in capital. The problem? When the centralized backer disappears, bye bye Tether and bye bye money. BitBays peg doesnt need to worry about hard fixed price, just a stable price. If they vote by an algorithm it's still elective. That's enforced on the client side so it's still Democratic and decentralized. The voting freezes supply that can also be unfrozen. It's strange to me that currency's (only) inflate. Currencies should be able to deflate as well. Coins freeze so that early investors get benefits of being early since they hold their frozen coins to be deployed as volume increases. Finding a target price might take a long time. But the most important guarantee is survival of a HEALTHY price of the coin. We can guarantee this because if it becomes unhealthy we deflate. Glad you brought up Tether also. Because we can do what they do but decentralized. Imagine Bill wants to back Bitbay but he's poor. So he and others vote for deflation. Now he decreases supply to 30k coins. He wants to guarantee a price of 30k so he takes 30k in btc and he places a buy wall. Now nobody can break his peg unless they vote to inflate. But Bill will see if the voting becomes unsustainable and remove the wall. Also he won't need 30k to hold it at a dollar anyways because it's a fallacy of proposition to think everyone will sell. Regardless the price will always be healthy and unlike a hard peg price can grow and is not stuck to the weakening dollar."

You cannot guarantee that volume will rise thus it really is just circling back to the same issue...its a cool solution to a general problem but not sure if it will do what you intend but hey lets see it go should be interesting.

A secondary market will also be part of this. We are in the infancy of crypto, so no one can guarantee anything for any coin. BitBay and syscoin can both be dead two years from now for reasons none of use are able to foresee. Or one or both of them can become biger than bitcoin. There is no telling.

It's not the only factor which sets price thus you cannot guarantee a certain price. This is why I was saying the market will deflect into a volume based market where trading will happen based on projections of volume peaks instead of price... it will be interesting to see if volatility can be avoided this way since there is always a herd affect near peaks and troughs which bring in volatility... so instead of price crashing you might see volume crashing instead and then the question is what would bring about new volume again. Who knows what the actual price will be when these peaks are found.

And if it works the price should stay in a steady bullish channel even on some low chart time frames.

        "Yeah that's partly true. It depends on how miners vote. However my assumption is, miners will vote for whatever makes them more money. So if they see low volume and very low price they will deflate. If they see high volume they inflate. But remember, investors can also watch those global deflation rates correct? So miners aren't doing anything that won't be seen coming a mile away. Also perhaps if the software itself cast votes automatically by an algorithm then chances are miners will not be able to go against the algorithm just like it's hard to swim against a tide. Finally, you can guarantee an exact dollar price if you deflate a lot. I'm not recommending it, but in theory that means a group of miners can do it like Tether but self backed and if one backer disappears then someone else can freeze gradually to their comfort level and take their place. Extreme example: Deflate from 1 billion to 1000 coins, back with 1000 dollars and now it's exactly a dollar a coin. If that backer leaves anyone can take his place. Also secondary markets for frozen coins is not a design flaw, it's one of the best features. Since frozen coins can be moved with a 3 month time lock, they serve as credit swaps, bonds, and even trustless loans. So we hope to see that happen As to not having a whitepaper the community specifically asked me not to do this since it would give way too technical of a breakdown of how it's coded. And we want to be the first to release it. It certainly will be open source."

There was a bunch of other things too. In order to keep my freedom and avoid 9-5 had to come up with a strategy to lower my expenses so I lost a month or so. I did some coding but it wasn't enough. I did code a really cool anti-keylogger password thing. It's badass. Say bye bye to screen recorder and loggers. Plus I fixed allof the bugs and sync problems so the software is really robust. I started hosting the nodes myself since I noticed the old ones were down. Anyways I'm on the contract now lol my friend is managing me. I'm also doing one for him we have a list of habits to break... no eating out, hitting the gym daily etc. Stuff we are forced to do or lose our deposits. Most importantly many hours of coding daily. I have to sign off on it daily applying for daily time extensions and report back how many lines of code I contributed and what the code was. He's working on a different project related to construction. It's a spreadsheet with a cost breakdown of all the alternative building heating cooling methods for low cost decentralized housing. Such as 3d printed housing, Aircrete(Google it, it's amazing), Silo Homes, Earthbags and about 20 other awesome types of construction. Actually anyone who is interested in that can PM me especially if you have feedback on new techniques or want to see the sheet. Anyways so I might force myself to report here every few days but for now I'm keeping the requirements realistic."

        "So for example...  Imagine an exchange above has on average 75 million coins on their exchange and 50 million of them are owned by investors hoping to cash in on the extra benefits of a stake pool minting new coins. Since the network will never be able to stake all coins in circulation due to various reasons, this exchange would earn more than the typical %1 ROI coded into the protocol. For example again, lets say this particular exchange is averaging about %2.5 stake reward. The exchange could retain %0.5 for themselves and the investor %2.0.  So lets do some math to prove why an exchange would want to become involved. 50 million @ 2.5% annual ROI = 1.25 million coins per year ROI. Exchange retains 20% of that total = 250,000 coins per year or 684 coins per day. If the peg was set at 0.1 USD per coin, they'd make 68.40 dollars per day ='s nearly 25,000 dollars per year if the price remains the same. Yet the rolling peg protocol, will be designed to help the coin hopefully rise in price without the volatility. So if the exchange decided to hold their coins till the end of the year... well you see where this is going! Should be interesting to say the least as this doesn't even take in consideration the fees generated through day traders. No other coin in existence will be able to reward an 'exchange' the way BitBay will! And only Halo coins will be able to provide investors and traders with the capability to provide the tools necessary to create 'trustless' exchanges!"

I attempted to hire in SE Asia and they were way too slow and didn't even commit a single line. It would waste more time to teach them than to do it myself. A few other coders have been very slow to reply to emails or have tried a refactor and quit after about a day of work leaving me with nothing to commit. So I've done 100% of the code. As for the daemon we use Blackcoin source which has been very reliable. Rat4 added some nice cold staking commands so that was helpful. And I was one of the people to message the Bitmessage dev and encourage Aetheros to fix the source of Bitmessage which is what I use to make decentralized markets. The code itself is almost 50k lines. I could reduce it by making it more modular but it's a bit late for a refactor. I don't host on github since I've got doubts that enough people would commit and it would more likely get forked and cloned with dubious ideology. So we host on github after we finish. Also you can download source directly in my server and build from that with variable names changed which is good enough for audits."

Thank you Templates are great and all but to all other outsiders. It means nothing. The reason is because there is no marketing or explanation about it. Ideally, you want your marketing team to take screen shots of the new templates and explain what they do and paint a story about how its used. Or videos about it. So far I see none of that, which is why the coin is illiquid. And stagnant and outside of top 100 on coinmarketcap without any volume, so I think shifting gears to peg may be better."

That doesn't make you just a theif but a propagandist. Nice Israeli military connects in the family Bob perhaps you do this for a living? Let me advise you how goverments do their dirty work. They hire guys just like you who get caught using fake profiles on Social media and Bitcointalk and other platforms of controlled opposition. In fact let me show you the exact organization leaked by Snowden that does these operations in the good old North America. Don't worry I realize there is more than one. Unless you blow the devil for free? Did I mention I have friends in the Intel industry?! Back off Bob. Im not as naive as you think and neither are the investors. You wanted me as a \"partner\" so you could propagandize me that's why I stayed as a dev and not your partner. I would never partner with you no matter how much money. Also did you notice the DIFFERENCE in Bitbay?? Download the software see for yourself. I released the world's first decentralized markets. It works baby. Suck it. No help, no so called Asian devs (trust me they cant dev tic tac toe) and no, believe it or not no Asian hookers. Did have a GF for a few months tho. Because Bob software takes hard WORK something you are allergic to. 50k lines of code doesn't write itself. What work did you do? Paul sent me the nice document you guys made preparing for how to respond to FUD and how to socially engineer everyone... and people even tipped me off about how deceptive you are. If by work you mean hiring Vindyne? Or maybe your friends kidcrypto, Tor, Iconicexpert? Lots of nice anonymous names you guys have to hide behind. Must be nice bro. Actions speak louder than words Bob. You admit to dumping coins constantly so you assume everyone is as evil as you. But shockingly I haven't sold a single Bitbay. I'm investing in myself. Everyone here KNOWS my wallets. The news even reported in my favor. The wallets are listed on Reddit go see for yourself. The only negative PR I have is from your fake profiles dumping chat logs on Bitcointalk. Since Theymos is govt trash who works for a senate office, he prefers to ignore emails about you and your friends abusing devs on here and violating laws against cyberbullying/privacy/deception and his own self proclaimed no FUD policy. But if you DOX Theymos prepare to be banned. Beleive it or not, I don't care about my reputation. I think you underestimated me. There are more important things than reputation. We can list the change log if you like with the 100s of improvements you can even look at my dev environment. First decentralized markets, the world's only smart contracting software, and soon to be pegged. You better bet you need to propagandize it. That's your only defense. Because you can't kill an idea."

Heck, with BitBay now \"YOU\" have the ability to charge your clientele a completely customizable service fee if you wish to. It's even going to have a shipping calculator built into the client to help you determine final closing costs in an encrypted escrow negotiation chat box. The possibilities are nearly endless.

Their peg already fell this year although it was a great buy. I did advise slack people to buy it. Bitbay is decentralized, there is no custodians, no trading tricks, no fancy nonsense. Its just pure and simple decentralized freezing and unfreezing of supply equally for all users. This gives early investors a huge advantage by the way since your frozen coins will serve as a future. However you will only have access to enough liquidity to not crash the market. Since its decentralized we can choose the price we want. We dont want too high because that throttles volume and liquidity. But slowly building towards a target is almost unstoppable. Plus it opens the doors for decentralized backing, and lots of options with frozen assets like credit swaps, trustless lending based on trade of frozen for liquid and a secondary market"

Other times it writes itself. I had to self teach myself Python and then when hitting bugs there was nowhere to look on the internet for how to fix them so I had to get creative. There was lots of trial and error. Sometimes a typo would set me back for days! Some bugs required their own devs to fix such as Bitmessage dev and I sent multiple reports to him about how it was broken. Sure enough that got fixed. It would be awesome to find some dev help however training and motivating them would probably just slow me down at this point. No, I will probably have to finish it myself unless we get outside funding.

        "Well, considering how much negative PR it was for Ethereum to revert their bug, I think nuking their wallets could backfire. Personally I like the idea but the hard core coin enthusiasts will argue against centralized maneuvers. ETC \"Classic\" was such a monkey wrench for ETH and I'm not sure they will ever recover from that. They might but it causes tons of confusion to new buyers. Also it would be difficult to prove which wallets were theirs... perhaps freeze them until they identify themselves or carefully track it, however there is a lot involved in that. Our slack group seems to have a good idea of who owns what. Consider that anywhere from 30-60% of Bitcoins are stolen from exchanges or government seizure or escrow failure. Not to mention \"Satoshis wallet\" who nobody seems to know who owns it. So considering that, its probably just best to build a good coin. A lot of their coins have been bought by the core team already too. Our distribution is actually pretty good compared to other coins."

He has been known to release private messages to courts to help prosecute companies(which i think is extremely unethical). But then he won't stop serial scammers that have been abusing the forums. In theory because the forum is moderated, he has a fiduciary responsibility to remove any attempts of impersonation, and blatant privacy violations. What's funny is, I have seen threads explaining how Theymos has done favors for moderators which shows he's also a hypocrite. For example one guy insulted a mod and Theymos helped remove the offending posts. The guy works for a Senate office and is basically a total sellout and schill. Not to mention he raised Bitcoins and kept them in a few scandals of his own. Also I sent Theymos PMs, emails, even contacted on Reddit and he ignored me never a single reply not even just as a gentleman. So yeah it casts serious doubt on the agenda of Bitcointalk. As for my agenda honestly if you saw all the early chat logs you will see how most the convos were about tech. Steven offered to pay to use Halo tech at the time being 100 btc plus 10% of the coin which he offered to buy on the exchange. Bob came in with Ryan days before and asked if I would split a portion of what was raised and said they would set aside at least 500 btc for dev fund. Considering it wasn't my project, the deal looked good obviously and I had not considered that all 4 of them were liars. Unfortunately, I never complained about how they structured the project which I realize was something that I should have done. I never asked why they were getting similar portions as the main dev. At the time I said I only wanted to be a project manager and they could hire devs. Lin said he had devs but that turned out to be bullshit. I figured at least Steven would stay on board. Not having control of finances was obviously a huge problem. And it took me a couple weeks to expose them. Consider during that time they were extorting from everyone anyways. What would you do if you saw them faking volume? If I told investors immediately, it would have ended up the same anyways. I'm not sure if being quiet about it for two weeks was wrong or not but that's why I had shifted gears to pegging early. The advantage of waiting was at least i got more evidence against them which helped defend us. They were the ones in control of BCT so that worked against the project too. Even the news saw all my chat logs and was unable to find anything showing I knew in advance. Anyways that's old news. If anything it makes for a crazy story. However success is very sweet revenge and it would be totally awesome if this works out as planned. The ideas are sound. All that's left is hard work. I think this coins distribution is way better than a lot of premine coins. For example I was told Fuelcoin dev had more than 90% of the supply. I've heard similar things about Scotcoin. Not sure which allegations are true. If I had a coin honestly I would distribute based on valid Reddit or Facebook profiles since those are hard to fake."

I realize insulting Theymos isn't the best idea hahahaha. It is just something most people don't realize about this forum. Unfortunately it suffers from poor management. It's still the best forum for investors obviously. I know people don't like Facebook or Google because of all they do to violate our privacy and how they manipulate information. However, what other platforms are there for fair distribution?! I mentioned Reddit for that exact reason.

Perhaps mining and ICO and distribution to valid Facebook/Reddit/Gmail profiles?! Steemit did that and found fast adoption."

Then there is BitUSD. They use collateral in BTS. It's interesting but relies on BitShares staying alive and costs alot of BitShares to put/call. It works for now. It is a low market cap at 100k Then there is Tether. So far it works but it depends entirely on their company backing the coin. None of those pegs are scalable, none of them can roll in price. They aren't attractive to speculators either. BitUSD is probably the most promising since Tether can fall at any minute. But if BitShares falls so does BitUSD. In Bitbay even if Bitcoin falls, Bitbay survives! It's decentralized and no backers or custodians required. However out peg can fluctuate in price.

        "That's just it - there isn't a safe one that I know of! BitBay's approach will be different obviously. It's not going to be pegged to anything, e.g., bitcoin, gold, USD, etc. It's going to be completely independent; simply based on supply and demand. This can make for a day trader's 'wet dream'. I wish I knew more about it myself, but take for example all of the possibilities in regards to a Bay to BTC market pair. If a trader see's signs of a big price drop coming to BTC, rather than sell out his BTC to USD, he could accumulate BitBay instead over the course of a few days. There would be more than one way to do this. He could potentially buy them \u00a0straight from the exchanges, straight off the BitBay marketplace (without a middleman), or even a potential 'futures' contract. If the traders hunch is correct and BTC starts to drop over the course of a few days, then others will be scrambling to hedge their investment capital. This would create an increase in demand to Bay from traders trying to hedge their investment capital would naturally cause Bay to increase in value.  Now this trader has multiple options...   \u00a0 All of this can be taking place with the trader having assurance that the peg will protect his capital from a potential 'back-stabbing' whale dump that currently seems to plague so many coins with their >insertcoin</BTC market pair relationship, because in BitBay, if the market gets hit with a large seller all at once, your coins would freeze proportionally to your existing quantity. This helps the price balance out without any major FOMO panic sells.  BitBay will give investors a tool to increase profit potential compared to the option of hedging back to the USD. Sure there is no leverage advantage, but that makes it even more attractive to conservative money. And who knows... with Double Deposit Escrow, I'm sure there is a way to create leverage.  The more people see the system as a safe investment, the more they will want it, increasing demand and price in a healthy, organic trend. This will excite merchants and naturally create a positive, organic domino effect. For those that can't stand the idea of a mandatory network adjustment to their wallets liquid to frozen coin ratio, they will still have options to trade - that's where the futures contracts come into play.  Again, I wish I knew more about all the goodies in store for the rolling peg (UVP - User Value Protection) protocol.  We will just have to wait a little bit longer before it's finally implemented."

        "Thats correct. And because they control it, they will adjust the supply to whatever is healthy for trading. The whole point of it is to give it a way to regulate its own value without centralized institutions including backers, fancy trading tactics, put and sell tactics, custodians and government or political policy. It just gives all users control over the most BASIC rule of value. Supply and demand! We control the supply, and the frozen assets are still there to reward early investors... something they can sell as a \"future\" or bond or collateral for a loan in exchange for liquid coins at any time. Or they can hold the frozen coins until inflation comes and at a higher price. So with that there are two speeds of money. Liquid high speed money and frozen extremely slow speed money. And I see no reason why other coins won't be inspired to start their own variations of the freezing tactic. Other coins may want to make a coin with a slower interest rate or variable or use different voting algorithms or even add an incentive for parking coins (like NuBits) which would be in effect a bond. Anyways this makes crypto what it should have been! It should have been \"programmable money\". But people keep trying to make Bitcoin similar to the USD. But why should we be forced to treat crypto like dollars when we can control the economy itself?? Its more or less like a decentralized bank. Anyways, the only trust we have to place is in exchanges to hope they wont oversell coins. It would hurt them if they allow it because the miners would deny withdraws. Of course the one thing we can't control is Demand! But by controlling supply we can make it match the demand. If for example, I made a piece of artwork, and it was the only piece of its kind, the supply would be \"1\". So as long as one person wants that art piece upon seeing it the art will sell. In this case, you can adjust your supply down to the demand and thats fairly easy to predict and read since we have a daily volume on the exchange which gives us an idea of what the demand is. When pegging starts up, I'm guessing that volume will go up. And then being the first coin to do this will make it so the volume should always be sufficient for speculators or at least for investors here to see a return on their investment. I guess time will tell."

        "My apologies in advance for what I know must end up as a long winded post, but I'm starting to realize a lot of people don't know much about pegging. If you look at it schematically there are only two kinds of peg, asset based and trust based. Asset based peg was the first generation of pegs. Governments or institutions like banks would hold an amount of gold or silver that equaled the value of the money or IOU's they issued. The gold standard is the most commonly known variation of this, and has several subclasses. There are several problems with asset based pegs.  1. The value of the asset can change dramatically like it did when the silver standard broke down. 2. It's not practical to have an asset that is physical like gold because it's time consuming, expensive, and risky to move around when needed. 3. At the end of the day an asset based peg is also a trust based peg because you trust the government or institution to have the amount of asset they claim they have. 4. Even if they have the asset, they can run away with it! This is especially a danger with crypto based asset pegs as you can imagine... 5. Most use cases can be solved cheaper by other means like SWAPS or CDF's. (It is possible to make financial instruments like those with Bay's smart contracts) The trust based peg is what we see in fiat. (Fiat is latin and means \"it shall be\". Referring to governments defining their their money is worth something and how much) \u00a0For most developed countries, Bretton Woods was the transition from asset based to trust based peg. Bretton Woods was originally mainly asset based (gold) but also had a trust based element to bridge temporarily gaps. Pegging is a complicated topic in fiat because most fiat has some pegging in it, declared or not. The reason is obvious. Trade surplus or defecit is heavily influenced by currency exchange rates, and thus influence a lot of other parameters you would want to control like unemployment, taxes, welfare, etc. The declared pegs are the easy ones to see, but they can vary a lot. First generation of fiat pegs used to be what I call hard pegs, meaning they don't allow much deviation from target. This is what we have in Bretton Woods with +/- 1%. The advantage of the hard peg is of course it's stability when it holds, giving very predictable terms for trade etc. The disadvantage is that it is the easiest to break, and that it creates a shock in the economy when it breaks. Establishing a trustworthy new hard peg after your first one is broken is also difficult. Hard pegs are relying heavily on buy/sell walls either de facto placed, or (more commonly) expected by the market when outer limits of the peg are reached. There are two main reasons why the hard peg is the easiest to break: 1. Over time the fundamentals in the countries economy or the ability to defend the peg may change a lot, and thus make the pegged value unrealistic. That is an open invitation for traders to break the peg. 2. It is very profitable for traders to break a peg because of the fomo it creates when it's broken. Hard or relatively hard pegs in fiat have a long tradition for failing. Modern pegs tend to be softer i.e. allow more movement, and are often not declared at all. They don't provide the same predictability as the hard ones, but are considered more robust. Have you noticed that many central banks keep mentioning inflation targets? They are often a key element in modern pegs because they directly influence the amount of money printed, and thus are an important parameter in finding the \"correct\" exchange rate between currencies.  Sidhujag mentions a third peg described by Vitalik. A prediction based peg. That is not a peg. That is a lottery! Even though hard pegs have a history of failure, they would be much safer than the prediction based peg because they don't fail that often. Prediction based peg has much in common with the technical analysis many traders rely on. Just like TA, prediction based peg can be expected to often be a self fulfilling prophecy. But would you bet your house on it? I wouldn't. I'm not going to be a participant in the battle regarding the usefulness or \"truth\" in TA, but for those of you who don't know this; the theory behind TA is that the market is right, and that the collective knowledge of fundamentals is reflected in the price of a currency, commodity, or whatever. Well, in crypto there are few fundamentals compared to stock market or forex. This leaves the field wide open to whales. And news about fundamentals can have 10x the impact in crypto compared to forex. So I completely disagree with you sidhujag. Schelling coin would not be better than the pegging attempts we already see in crypto, it would be the worst of them all. That said, it's a fascinating concept, and I'm sure there are other use cases where it can have a lot of value. So, that was a lot about pegging in fiat. How is that relevant? Mostly not. But we use the term pegging, and fiat is where we can see what has worked and what not. Also the reason for one or the other. The reason pegging is so complicated in fiat is because, as I have mentioned before, it affects and is affected by so many factors in a country's economy. It's less complicated in crypto. If you go back to early posts by David you will see that it was not decided in the beginning if Bay should have a fixed (hard) peg or a rolling (soft) peg. Fiat shows us that rolling peg is much more robust, so that's why we go for that. There are a few other topics from macro economy like flow of money to consider too (remember 2008? That was not a lack of money, but a lack of trust that disturbed the flow of money), but they are really minor in the big picture.  To sum it up, BitBay's peg must be classified as a trust based peg, and has chosen the safer version -a soft peg. The rest is micro economics -supply and demand. The revolutionary concept is that it is decentralized! Every other peg is centralized, i.e., controlled and/or dependent on one person or group of persons. If he/they fail, the peg fails! What happens in a pegged coin that relies on custodians if the custodians don't think being a custodian is the best investment alternative for them? Those are the kind of problems we have eliminated by going decentralized."

I know bitusd is probably the best peg currently working.. although its not ideal because it relies on \"delegates\" and has hardcoded rules for 10% bands where price isn't allowed to be traded to avoid.. a better approach to bitusd is the CFD + Schellingcoin as described here:  Since we don't have any paper to know what your approach is its hard to know how it compares but I think the way you are describing it, it should be pretty similar to the last one."

If a coin is \"pegged\" but the functions it was designed for fail, what will happen? Say Bitbay becomes a big player in smart contracts and, it is pegged at 1 USD per coin. Now lets say the contract side is found to have a serious flaw that cannot be corrected destroying it's utility. What happens? Does the community continue to vote to maintain the peg or, do they decide to sell and run? I don't think you can completely depend on the peg feature to maintain value if the rest of the system becomes useless. While I do agree that loosing the peg would create a situation that may not be recoverable, I also believe that the failure of the underlying technology may be even worse. It's a Ying/Yang relationship.  This why I don't mind whatever time it takes to develope and prove the coins functions prior to pegging even if there are others doing the same thing. The rest is marketing..."

Trouble is BAY needs whale interest. Whales are on larger exchanges. Bittrex is not enough these days. I mean look at the junk of polo. Some of those coins are total and utter garbage. Some have no development in months and the wallets barely work. I mean if we can even find a way to boost volume on bittex and get attention of polo and show them the work and dedication behind this project it would be impossible for them not to add us.

I know in order to create a contract you have to include a small miner fee and your computer has to incorporate some POW to broadcast over the bitmessage network (which takes about 1 - 5 minutes). What else is there in place? I mean lets say someone tries to DDos the default BitBay marketplace - would that affect the entire network or just that specific bitmessage 'chan'. Meaning if Alice had a marketplace called \"Alice's shop\", that bitmessage 'chan' wouldn't be affected by a DDos attack on others 'chans'? And if it only affects those computers that are subscribed to a specific 'chan' is there any way for a user to remove the default BitBay 'chan' for such an event (if that's the 'chan' they attack)? What if there was some sort of algorithm that could distinguish a potential DDos attack and temporarily increase miner fee's for such an attack? Or if new users had a higher fee at first, and based on reputation system of just 1 or 2 completed contracts, the miner fee returns to minimal amounts? Just wanting to brainstorm on the issue. Thoughts?"

The main weakness to this feature in my opinion is the amount of trust it requires, because if you don't trust the counterparty then you obviously can't know for sure if they send you an image with a virus included. Is there any safe loophole to work around this issue? Could we use imgur or something like that to help?"

        "Yeah the possibilities are nearly endless. Heck just for example... Let's say we use the same advertising idea for employment! The employers and employee's reputation status would help employers looking for employees or employees looking for employers. The top rated of each would receive the best offers to choose from. It would be like a domino effect. Heck with a little coding we could crosschain the system. Let's say you are an employer that owns only BitBay. You only use BitBay's employment market to outsource your workload demand. Yet for what ever reason, you have no luck finding anybody on BitBay's market for your employment contract. You decide to check out BitHalo and notice that there are quite a lot of people selling their services for the same employment demand you desire.  So to make things simple you'd somehow have the option to include both bitbay and bithalo to advertise your issue! The P2M advertisement could automatically convert Bays for Bitcoins (depending on your request, e.g., a 40% to 60% ratio), to perform the P2M markerting advertisement campaign on to both BitBay and BitHalo client users.  Obviously with it automated, it would make it that much easier to complete the process which would increase usage. It could also work both ways - Bays for Bitcoins or Bitcoins for Bays. Heck this could be a standard feature built-in that some people might want to use all the time in their advertising and hit both top target groups in each coin's client. All the while you are maximizing the 'capitalistic' approach to the matter as you are maximizing (to your budgets limits) the # of possible top associated counterparties, therefore creating an auction/bid style contract to receive the highest quality return at the most affordable price."

It's frustrating knowing where the price is now with all the features it currently has working. In all honesty, after the rolling peg is complete and all it's features that spin off from it, I really don't think there will be another coin out there that will be able to match the number of features BitBay will have built into the wallet. Sure Bitcoin has an unknown amount of 3rd party features, but that's because it's king. But if there was a column on an exchange that tracked features in a coin, BitBay would already be in the top 5, and like I said after he finishes the peg, it will be 2nd to Bitcoin in total features. And by then I'd think the masses could no longer ignore this fact and begin to contribute to it. As David's goal is to include python programmable smart contracts. These are not to be compared to ether's smart contracts because David doesn't want to bloat the blockchain with a bunch of smart contracts.  They won't be as fast as ether's because they are obviously python and not C++, but they won't bloat the system. He found a way to structure and secure these python programs without the need for it to be on the blockchain yet still secured by miners!! Here's his thoughts on the matter from a previous post: So lots more to come."

        "Yeah, thanks for the interest and kind words. I think there has been some issues with the owner of BCT causing us to have no luck with SEO capabilities. Yeah, supporters have been trying to get us on poloniex through the request form, but right now the volume is probably too low. I think that could change once poloniex realizes that they could essentially stake BitBay on their exchange securely because wallets have 2 private keys and the client has a joint account system. So they could have a 'hot' cold wallet staking because they could run the wallet on 2 separate computer devices. A hacker would have to penetrate both devices to gain access to the 'hot' cold wallet. So essentially they could stake trader's coins while they are trading. This could create all sorts of interesting features, especially after the coin completes the rolling peg tech. Since BitBay is converting to Proof of Stake 3.0, exchanges have the capability to gain higher stake reward percentages as it would virtually turn into a mining pool with various return percentages provided to the traders.  This would allow for an exchange like poloniex to reap a fair amount of stake coins for their own benefit. They would give the most back to the traders, but retain a cut for the service. The way I understand POS 3.0 is that with BitBay starting off with 1 billion coins at 1% inflation per year, no matter what the total number of coins will increase by 1% (10 million coins). So if only 5 people with a combined total of 5 million coins were staking in the entire network for one year, Then those stakers would gain the 10 million coins by the end of the year based on their percentages of coins owned. That's way more than a 1% ROI. It's impossible for every coin to stake in the network. So no matter what, the return will be higher than 1%. Currently Bittrex has over 100 million coins sitting in their exchange waiting to be bought. With the volume capabilities of poloniex, if BitBay was traded there, that amount could possibly triple. So with \u00a0300 million coins on average staking over the course of a year and the rest of the network is only staking 400 million, then polo would essentially earn 42.8% of the 10 million minted.  Doesn't seem like much, but if you factor in a random peg value of $0.10 (just as an example, no one knows the starting peg value), then polo would be minting a total of USD 428,000.00 per year!!!!! Granted a lot of it would go back to the traders, but I'm sure they could create incentives to alter that, like free trading for traders who hold over 50,000 BitBays on the exchange. No other coin can offer this feature an exchange (mainly because of price stability from rolling peg technology) So yeah, I agree BitBay should be on poloniex, because in the future we will help them make a shit load of money! Edit: None this even takes in consideration that Bittrex an Poloniex could actually buy the coin for themselves because of this capability. So essentially for the first time, you could have exchanges that not only allow for traders to trade it, but they would also have financial 'strings' attached to it so they would help protect the value of it!"

        "I totally agree with your thoughts. I'm not a big advocate of even holding coins on an exchange - once your done trading, withdraw immediately.  But as history has shown time and time again, that even after exchanges get hacked over and over, traders still end up leaving their coins in them for extended periods of time. With that in mind, we might as well work with what they want. Yes, you are right Polo and Bittrex do not stake POS coins at the moment, but that's because they are afraid to because they would increase the exposure of these wallets to outsiders wanting to hack them. They would be deemed 'hot' wallets because they are online and running in order to mint new coins. They don't want to risk the possibility of their reputation if someone hacked their system. Once hacked, the first thing the hackers would go for is the 'hot' wallets. So for extra security they maintain their wallets in cold storage or offline. These can still be hacked buy in my opinion it typically can only be done by an insider in the exchange. So the whole point of my post above is that with BitBay, it's unlike 99% of the other coins out there, as you are capable of using 2 private keys to access and run 1 wallet. So this gives a lot more options to the user. Not only can these keys be encrypted with separate passphrases, David's added steganography to the client, so you could essentially hide the encrypted private keys inside images. With 2 private keys you can create joint accounts. Joint accounts would be no different than 2 business partners running a business and each partner has a key that unlocks the door to any funding they need to conduct business. It makes it impossible for 1 business partner to 'steal from the cookie jar' without the other's permission because the cookie jar has 2 locks on it. Joint accounts don't have to be for 2 business partners. You could essentially create a joint account for yourself. With this in mind, here is an example of how tight the security of BitBay really is... You could essentially passphrase protect one key, hide it in an image and store it on a laptop. The second key is also passphrase protected, hidden in an image, yet stored on a raspberry pi.  So in order for someone to hack your joint account wallet, they'd first have to simultaneously hack both computer devices. Then locate the images with the keys inside of them. Then crack the passphrase that protects the private keys. I'm not saying that anything is impossible in the world of hacking, but I'm sure you could ask around - this wouldn't be easy to do by a long stretch! Now with that in mind - imagine applying that to an exchanges cold wallet, hence why David calls it 'cold staking'. The exchanges wallet could be 'hot' yet it's a joint account setup and only 1 key is hot while the other key cold and hiding on another computer device. This could most likely only get hacked by an insider. So yeah, polo and bittrex do not stake coins because they are afraid of exposing the hot wallets to hackers, but with BitBay's Halo Client, now they have a way to stake them and it would essentially be no different from still calling it a 'cold wallet'. So why not stake and retain the rewards for profit? I hope that clears things up for you. This is just one reason of many why I'm very bullish about the future of BitBay."

So a hacker would have to hack a minimum of 2 passwords (if he's lucky) or up to 6 passwords (if he's unlucky) to find the image with the key (that's password protected) out of 5000 different images."

However, we've overcome so much already despite of this, some hard core community members are trying to help David with any future marketing funds needed to start pushing out a strong campaign. This should create a domino effect (as I've mentioned before) because Proof of Stake coins hold a huge advantage over Proof of Work coins; supporters don't have to fear a centralized entity curbing the minting of new coins. So as the price increases so will the marketing funding. In my opinion it could grow into a marketing campaign the likes of which Bitcoin could only 'drool' over!"

But what if one of the keys was on one computer and the other private key was a joint account key with 2 keys on 2 separate computers. Wouldn't that make a joint account with a joint account and virtually create a system with the capabilities to hold a 'hot' cold wallet on 3 computer devices? Couldn't that make for an endless loop of security? As the 2nd key could keep splitting into 2 more keys? So if an exchange like bittrex wanted to stake the coins (on average they've held around 115 million Bays for 2 years - that's a lot coin minting power they are throwing away!), they could essentially have the cold wallet on 4 to 5 different devices, passphrase protected (with timed anti-keylogger security), and hidden in images? It would make it unhackable! They only way they could hack the system is if it's an inside job.

The anon aspect is still going strong. I say ride out every fad so long as it does not interfere with the core project. There is nothing wrong with riding hype waves with all the other projects that offer far less. Bay will eventually take the lead above most other projects on this board but it has been a long hard slog with no real funding. Most devs would have fled by now taking their new ideas to another project.  I see btcd/komodo or crypti/lisk as the road we could have gone. I would have liked to see what a few fancy graphics with all the features bay has or nearly has implemented could have attracted in developement funds. Plus I feel with enough resources david can produce above and beyond what 99% of devs can here. The path we have gone is longer and harder but may well be more rewarding in the end for those that stayed the course. Let's hope so. Q1 of 2017 isn't a mile away so it would have been nice to have some hype and attention on the project for when it shows its full potential. I wonder how many superior products lose out to inferior ones due only to marketing and spin.... I bet it would be a huge %"

Anonymous broadcasting is better than almost all anon except for the top ones (SDC, Monero, Nav, Zcoin, Zcash) Anon broadcast has very few flaws. People can only exploit Bitmessage in that example. However it takes time to do POW in Bitmessage and then you have to wait and see if your transaction gets in the chain. From an engineering standpoint, it may not be worth it to sidetrack when we already have so many great features. I say let's get the important templates done get the API done and of course finish pegging. Then we see what doors open."

However, SDC and Monero with ring signatures are a good second. And NAV is sort of 3rd. I think anonymous broadcast is better than most anon protocols but it isn't better if an exploit is found in Bitmessage so it all depends on how people audit that. ZCash is on another level because its zero knowledge proof. You can't know who moves what, only you can know your own balance. However ZCash is memory intensive and ZCoin claims not to be. In the end, anonymous broadcast is a low-tech and extremely simple system. I have no idea how someone would know who owns what account since your IP address is just thrown in the big pool of addresses and nobody in specific broadcasts. You would have to spoof a lot of nodes to break it. But like I've said, no reason to derail development. Lets just stay course and people will see very soon the power of Bitbay."

        "Wow so I'm starting to wake up more and more to the possibilities with Wallstreet opening up to trading stocks on the blockchain. Overstock will lead the way... So this should create all sorts of advantages for stockmarket traders. 1) Slippage potentially minimized  2) Commission fee's minimized 3) Naked short selling minimized Yet what's really caught my interest is how the ownership of stock shares will be stored. I mean it shouldn't be any different than how a typical cryptocurrency stores it's values right? The owner actually holds in possession of the stocks on his blockchain wallet. If it isn't set up that way yet for Overstock, I'm sure it eventually will. This will cause a huge decline in brokerage houses that 'hold' your portfolio in their 'middleman' possession, and rightfully so... It's 'yours' after all! So point being is that I don't see why we won't have a future where traders trade their shares like crypto currently does with exchanges like bittrex and polo. Yet here's the kicker, with Halo, now David can add a whole new paradigm to the equation. Traders will be able to trade freely and trustlessly any stock they want for any stock, fiat, or token of value they own. I don't see exchanges like polo or bittrex being able to add stocks into their list of markets anytime soon. The existing brokerage houses of wall street will fight tooth and nail over that. They will buy up the SEC so fast with red tape that I just don't see it possible in any quick manner. Yet with BitBay, it's decentralized, and can't be regulated since it's not a business and especially because it's not for profit. So even though BitBay doesn't have the current crypto traders on board realizing that they can trustlessly buy and sell any crypto for any crypto without having to go through a 3rd party escrow or exchange, I think that wall street waking up will be a different story. For example, if Mutual fund A wants to liquidate their 5% ownership of stock XYZ (for what ever reason) they could somewhat use their same chatbox channels to spread the word and once they find a buyer, they could literally sell securely through BitBay at a 0% slippage and commission fee. The possibilities are endless! Since all this will be after the peg, BitBay will not only turn into a great hedging tool, but also a leveraging tool as well. And again, without having to front a 3rd party brokerage house the funds! Man I can't wait to watch how Overstocks experiment works out in December!"

And in my opinion now that Trump was elected the Saudis and the Chinese are in full revolt and could be speeding up the process. This strengthens crypto because any sort of disruption in fiat stability causes investors (especially Chinese) to seek safe alternatives. In my opinion, bitcoin is currently trying to break through some heavy resistance levels because of this. If/once it does, I don't think we will ever see this price range again for BTC - hence why I'm going to invest more in crypto. I think BTC is going to break 800 USD soon. BitBay will soon have an unprecedented price stability feature, so all of this is relevant to BitBay because if the Chinese and Saudis are successful at 'de-throning' the USD as king, then in my opinion all fiat will go full retard in terms of price stability and BTC will become even more volatile. People will be looking for stability with hedging tools. Interesting times ahead."

The downfall of this is that it will create a spike in the price of goods made overseas and shipped to USA. This is going to create a massive demand for merchants and their clientele to search for more cost effective ways of trading!  So cutting out the middlemen is a must since it's finally possible with DDE! This should cause online retailers to lose sales, forcing reassessment of their profit taking in order to try to maintain volume.  Amazon, eBay, Alibaba, Etsy, etc., will all suffer and have to lower their quality of service in order to attempt to maintain their investor's current profit margin. This could be huge!!

        "Heres the website link or the main thread page has this; ----------------------------------------------------------- Pegging How can the freezing/hedging system peg Bay to US$, and how is it possible? Bay is made to be used by ordinary consumers. They want a currency with a predictable value and without volatility. For example, by deflating the currency, we can make supply match the demand on exchanges. This means we can keep the price equal to a peg price (for example $1). Pegging can be done by controlling supply. By freezing a percentage of the Bay in everyone\u0092s wallet we reduce supply to a level where it meets demand at the price we want. If coins get frozen then can I still sell them? In order to allow for a healthy and liquid market, we are considering allowing the sale of reserve coins. However, the condition is, you must lock the coins for 3-6 months and the new buyer will only receive them as reserve. This can allow for new people to enter the market with a long term investment. It may also be useful for large purchases without effecting the price, deposits without using liquid coins or even peer to peer good faith sales or exchange. There are many advantages to frozen assets like lending against them, giving discounts and large swaps. ----------------------------------------------------------- Hope this helps."

        "There are a lot of posts about the peg in this thread. Here is one I wrote some 20 pages ago: The rolling peg, as we call it, is a way to stabilize the value of Bay. We believe one of the obstacles for digital currencies is the volatility in price. Why would Alice and Bob start using a currency that can lose 20-50% of it's value in a day? Doesn't make sense. So we are coming with a solution to that. BitBay will be the first currency in the world with the ability to automatically regulate supply to meet demand at a target price. This is done by freezing/releasing Bay. It's basically the same thing that nations do when they increase or decrease money supply. It's just much easier to do because we don't have to factor in the effect on interest rates, unemployment etc. The peg is designed to be flexible. Meaning we are not targeting a fixed value of Bay versus USD. Price will be allowed to move, but the extreme pumps and dumps that we know from crypto will not be possible. Think of the peg as a way to make the price of Bay move similar to bluechip stocks instead of crypto. An added advantage of our peg is what we call UVP, user value protection. The following is a very schematic example of how that works. If you buy 1 bitcoin worth of anycoin and it drops 20% you will only have 0.8 bitcoin left if you are forced to sell. In BitBay this will be different after the peg is implemented. If you buy 1 bitcoin worth of Bay and it drops 20% that will result in coins being frozen to maintain value. 20% of your coins are now frozen, so you will still only get 0.8 bitcoin if you are forced to sell, But you still have 20% of your Bay. When demand picks up they will be released, and you can sell them."

        "Well I've been thinking a lot about the future of multi-sig. Obviously with \u00a0an individual account on the client you have control of both signatures. In a joint account you have control of 1 sig and your partner/counterparty has control of the other. The only downfall of such a joint account is that if one or the other drops off the earth never to be found again, if their partner doesn't have their private key and password (which would be highly unlikely) then those coins in that account are lost/burned forever. So I've been thinking on the matter, if we \u00a0could have multiple options for joint account setups we could correct this and use it to our benefit. If for example, when a joint account is created, what if it asks you if you want a both sides to have manual signature capabilities or just one side to be manual and the other side to be 'auto-only'! \u00a0 So with that in mind, inject that concept into an exchange account. You'd have \u00a0a joint account set up with them where they are always in auto-sig, so you still have full control of your coins, yet your side of the account can either be auto or manual. If you want to buy or sell your coins you'd have the choice to either manually or auto-sign the approval. So let's say someone hacks their system and tries to steal BitBay... before they could do it they'd need to hack your computer as well!  We could make it even better. With existing 2fa on exchanges, let's say the investor's computer gets hacked, his coins on the exchange would still be protected as long as he had 2fa in place and they don't have the capabilities to break his 2fa!! Any coins he doesn't have on the exchange would be in a separate personal account where he could spread onto to different devices! So the hacking issue would be nearly impossible! So now with this technique we could have a trustless exchange to interact with the trustless client!!! All of this with minimal retrofitting from the exchanges end - they are in auto-signature mode!"

David's going to release an small update very soon to alleviate some networking issues with the client and QT seed nodes. After that I'd be more than happy to test out a joint account with anyone here. We could create an account and then we could use that account to accept the BitBay faucet built into the marketplace. You'd get to see first hand how it works at no risk - the faucet is free obviously. After that we could transfer the coins to your personal account and I'd show you how it's done with either manual signature or auto signature. Like I said previously, in the future all it would take is to tweak the joint account to make it more one-sided. That way if you wanted to transfer coins to an exchange or money manager, you'd have a trustless setup where you still have full control of your coins even if something happened to your account partner - tweaked by locking one side of the account in auto-sig mode. The joint account is on my list of tutorial videos to make. But yeah I've tested it out with Munti and it works great and is very user friendly. It will be 100% complete on David's next 'major' update! That's where you will be able to create a joint account with yourself so you can have a private key on 2 separate devices. That way you could 'cold' stake your coins. The odds of a hacker stealing those coins in such a setup would be damn near impossible as they'd have to gain access to 2 computer devices simultaneously, then find your keys, then break through the passphrases!"

        "Yeah that is the beauty of BitBay. If it catches on as we hope then it will be perfect timing for the revolution coming to the stock market.  Overstock is getting closer and closer to \"issuing history's first public blockchain security\" Others will follow suit once they realize the potential. Brokerage houses will have to retrofit their ways, but what they won't realize until it hits them way too late is that David has created a tool that will give these new blockchain stocks and their investors the ability to trustlessly trade them without the need for a brokerage house at all.  I hate to say it but overstock is spending all this money to jump through the SEC regulations, and they've forked out a lot of money into a supposedly revolutionary \"t\u00d8\" brokerage house platform. I understand they want to be legit with SEC, but I don't see their platform holding any major relevance in the future of blockchain stock markets. Their platform will be forced to make profits and when this transition is complete, investors will have a choice between brokerage house platforms that charge a fee or protocols like BitBay that doesn't require any fee (except what the counterparties want to charge eachother!!). The choice will be easy to make especially because BitBay is trustless. I'm sure they are going to try to regulate the purchase and selling of these stocks inside the brokerage houses because well... the SEC crooks have to eat too and feel all important inside   \u00a0But again, they really don't know what they are dealing with here. There will be loopholes around these regulations via blockchain backed notaries/ colored coins.  The floodgates are about to open and BitBay will be able to provide it with peace of mind that the SEC can only cry about because we don't need them anymore! Check out overstocks latest update here"

Those of you that haven't had connection problems, don't really need to update now. You can wait for the next major update. The rest \u00a0of you should install this latest version. Please use only the download links in OP in this thread for the first few days. We have not updated on site yet. For those of you that are new here: BitBay has two wallets, QT and client. Atm QT is the only one that can stake, and the client has all the cool stuff like smart contracts, market and pay to email. QT will be abandoned as soon as the client can stake, and is therefore not updated. The seed nodes that are hard coded into the QT wallet are no longer working because the services that where providing them no longer exist. If you have trouble connecting to the network, you can either write a config file where you copypaste nodes from chainz,  !network \u00a0or you can try dropping the peers.dat from client download into BitBay/data folder. Edit: A big update that adds new functionality is just around the corner. But with the increased attention lately, we felt that it's important to get this one out quickly so new users dont have trouble connecting"

All you have to do to figure out David's intentions is see who still has a passion for BitBay and is still delivering on the promises that were made.\u00a0 When you do that, you will only see David.\u00a0 All the others are gone."

If people are not willing to spend time in researching what they are spending $1000's of BTC on then \u00a0thats their own fault. People not willing to read up on projects just remind me of petty school kids asking people what they should invest in like they did on Crypstys troll box. I personally do a lot of reading up on altcoin projects and am 100% confident Bitbay will be a big player and a top 15 coin. David is achieving things Etherium isnt and they have $50m to spend. Bitbay has a low marketcap compared to other similar coins like Syscoin due to marketing. Bitbay is 100% dev work. When the work is done time will be spent making people aware of the ground breaking software David has created."

He showed me the latest version and the future plans for BitBay. I can assure you that there is nothing like it out there. BitBay is a bleeping gold mine!!! Once the pegging system is finished, it will change crypto for good because it will provide stability to the altcoin market. What happened to David was very unfair but he took it as a challenge and is finishing up what he promised to the investors even though all the ICO funds were scammed by the founders. He has not been paid and told me that he is willing to give up all of his stake in Bay to see it succeed.

As most people know, the marketing is very limited and David needs to only focus on coding. 90% of marketing is community driven at the moment and with personal donations as the funding. So anyone willing to join in with community help would be much appreciated. After David's next major release here in a couple weeks, I think we can really start churning out some marketing.  As it's been mentioned a couple times before... The price has been purposely manipulated down for over the last 2 years. Yet that individual selling is nearly out of coins.  Reverting the blockchain is bad mojo, so take that in consideration right now! With this dumper nearly out of coins, this is why price is climbing and will continue to climb. Right now in my opinion we are simply needing just a handful more of serious investors to turn the table into a potential domino effect. After all the major upgrades are implemented by David, people building DAPs for Ether will realize they can do similar platforms on BitBay without the bloat and 'fuel' upkeep. So I see no reason why this coin won't hit 1 to 2 billion market cap in the next 2 years.  2017 is going to be the year worth watching BitBay very closely! After the next update, if we can get the price and volume to increase, everything will start falling in place and you will see one of the greatest 'underdog' comeback stories in the history of crypto!"

Second, the peg idea doesn't convince me too much. Holding people money for some time....i would go crazy if i have 1.000 dollars for example in bitbay coins and i can't use them who knows for how long... It would be better simply using Bitcoin or Monero for buying and selling inside Bitbay platform and instead of selling Bitbay coins to people, you sell them stocks/shares of Bitbay. Nowadays are borning too much coins, people cant buy Bitbay coins for using your platform, Siacoin for the storage services, Monero for privacy, Gamecredits for gaming.... People want simple stuff, that's why only two or three coins go very well now. Hundreds of coins in the mid term will have no success, now they are kind of working but mid and long term less than 1% will survive, but not because 99% of projects are bad, many are very interesting and good, just because can't exists hundreds of crypto coins."

        "Very good points... At the very beginning of this project, David, did try to find developers and was unsuccessful. At this point trying to include new devs, probably would make the end product release take even longer. \u00a0 The rolling peg can be a little complex, but as we get closer to the release a detailed explanation will be included. It has so many positives to it though that need better clarification.  First, if you buy 1,000 dollars worth of Bay (post-peg), all of those will be 100% liquid. The odds that the peg algorithm will all of a sudden decide to freeze 40-50% of total coin supply, is a very very slim possibility. Sure, at the beginning of the peg implementation the system will be more active in ratio adjustments, but as time goes by it should, in theory, become less frequent as the wealth is distributed out more evenly to more users. So in my opinion, someone who buys 1,000 USD worth of Bay post-peg probably wouldn't see more than a 10 to 20% ratio adjustment. And since that individual is already 100% liquid, it would only freeze their bag around 100 to 200 USD worth of value. The goal of the freeze is to reverse the direction of the market price, so in theory the odds are that the next ratio adjustment would be a 'liquify' adjustment rather than another freeze adjustment. Second, you've got to realize the potential advantage this feature will have for day traders. Rather than day traders trading back and forth between BTC/USD or BTCNY pairing (which are currently the biggest markets), and rather than just use BTC/Tethered USD on poloniex, now traders will have the option to 'compound' their interest with BitBay hedging! The marketing potential for this is huge!!!! Since BitBay will be using a rolling peg(price has fluctuation) it will allow traders to risk investing in one in hopes that the market increases and then investing in the other in hopes that the market increases. By timing the markets right they have the ability to make more money rather than just the typical BTC/USD pairing market. The rolling peg will give investors peace of mind knowing that if they missed a 'window of opportunity' they don't have to fret much because the rolling peg will protect their investment capital and, in theory, overtime the value of BitBay will continuously rise as more and more users buy it. That's what's so cool about the rolling peg. It's not based on pegging to the dollar or gold, but rather, its value is based on supply and demand alone. So it's only weakness is lack of user interest. It doesn't have to worry about whether or not USD dumps 5% in a month, or if BTC dumps 15% in a month, or if gold dumps, etc., it's all based on user interest, and those market's volatility factors just mentioned will help increase interest in BitBay. So yeah it should be noted that those that currently hold BitBay will be hit the hardest on the initial peg implementation. But that shouldn't be much of an issue in their eyes if the price also increases 200 to 1000% from whence they purchased their pre-pegged BitBay. \u00a0 One main aspect I like about BitBay is that it forces us out of debt-driven economics. It forces you to save your money and be patient for when the price goes down. It forces you to have enough reserve to buy items on the marketplace as if you could buy it twice over. And yeah I understand people want simple stuff, but after you see these new videos about to be released on the next update, you'll see that BitBay really isn't that complex. If you want to trade it however, providing complexity for opportunity is not a bad thing, in fact, traders will demand it. It doesn't mean you have to trade like them though. You can still go with the basic buy low and sell high principle.  And as for the marketplace, if you are new to BitBay, and you see an item that's worth 15 USD of Bay and the seller requires a true double deposit escrow, you'd simply be investing and buying at the same time. So for that example a user would simply buy around 32 USD of BitBay. That way they can make their escrow deposit and account for any potential peg algo adjustments, and hopefully make some money off capital gains in the process if they wanted to sell out afterwards. Again, BitBay helps people to learn to save money, which isn't a bad thing! \u00a0 So hang in there and \u00a0thanks for being so patient!"

We have achieved a $1m marketcap just by word of mouth!! The famous saying is \"If you build it they will come\" We are at the early stages of crypto still where people want to make a quick profit in a few days and not do any research into what they are buying. When the people that really count start investing into crypto (billion dollar companies) they will look at actual product and the technology! What has been created and not what is 'promised'.

There is no reason to treat victims as pariahs only criminals like the scammers that stripped the project of its dev and marketing funds. You and many others have doubts fair enough these are justified so far. there is no network effect, the project is unfinished. Some say david should break all ties with bc and go 100 % bit bay since we are the only community to appreciate and support him. I listen to all these things but still I think this project has a great dev and is way too undervalued. I am sure once this takes off david will see bitbay was the right way to go and focus everything on this project. If it takes off he will be rewarded for his time and we will be rewarded for our risk and effort too. Nothing is a sure thing in crypto. You pays your money you takes your choice. I choose bay along with only a few select other projects for the vast bulk of my crypto investment. Others can choose as they wish. Everyone should do their own indepth research. If you can really find a better risk to reward ration project on this board please PM me I am not a closed minded zealot of any project but i think Bay is a great opportunity one of the best if not the best around. If you feel otherwise and have done your research then you could be correct who can say. Nobody knows for sure at this point who will be the winners in this sphere."

        "This specifically I cannot agree with more. It is almost human nature to blame victims as \"might makes right\" seems to be peoples attitude towards all things. Since liars have the advantage, they usually prevail especially since propaganda is not illegal and hard to take action against even when legal action is potentially possible it is completely unfeasible. The entire PURPOSE of Halos double deposit is to obviate and in many cases eliminate the need for courts and the legal system all together. Unfortunately propaganda is a more complex problem which is why I've said many times before decentralizing the media is many times more important than decentralizing the money. However any serious investor is not so naive anymore and should research a project, more importantly download and test drive the product. Thats why we offer a fawcet in the client for testing contracts. With that said, I think anyone here in crypto already knows this. Almost everyone with few exceptions knows this is a legitimate project because they can download the software and use it. Unlike 99% of projects we have hundreds of little features that are actively working. So Lituation for example is playing \"devils advocate\" and he knows it. The only thing standing in the way of Bitbays public acceptance is lack of marketing. And that is essentially a problem that can be solved. It is better to market with technology instead of marketing empty handed. Sure there is always the \"get money first and code later\" strategy but as most people who know about this project and Halo project they know that is not how we operate. If you want to follow a \"market first code later\" project then Ethereum is the best candidate for that. \"Oh we have bugs, but who cares about our users if they lose money eq. DAO\" Also with BLK there is no reason for me not to support that project, its part of the Halo suite and has distinct features that Bitbay doesn't have. Or at least it used to with the multipool. The difference here is Bitbay I have control over the Github whereas any additions to BLK need to go through rat4. And they aren't a fan of pegging tools... but I'm not sure they fully realize the power of the tool being made here. And thats okay, no two coins are alike nor should they have to be. That is the beauty of crypto. That consumers will get options instead of being forced to use USD. And I guarantee you, once Bitcoin is mainstream people will care about features. They won't give a shit about a project that has a DOGE face or a stupid Trump meme. They will care about what the coin can do for them."

David is very close to releasing an update for it. This update will include staking in the client as well! At that point you will start seeing a lot more people moving to the client as it will actually be more secure than the QT wallet as the client will have cold staking capabilities - the first of its kind for crypto! I'm actually going to pick up my raspberry pi today at the post office. I can't wait to set it up with David's linux version of the client. That way I'll be able to have a joint account setup with 2 computer devices, each holding their own private key. That way I'll be able to 'cold stake' with my account. Hackers would have to simultaneously hack both devices and security features in order to access account - virtually impossible! Eventually the QT will become obsolete and Bay will move exclusively into the client - that will happen once the rolling peg is implemented. Until then people will still be able to use the QT."

        "We want more people to learn about the awesome unbreakable contracts offered by BitBay and Halo. There is a fawset in the marketplace  Here is a training video of a contract being done: For those of you that are new here: BitBay runs using \"unbreakable contracts\" using double deposit. Its been a few years running flawlessly. The fawcet uses the \"guarantor\" contracts where the deposit is only made by the seller (unilateral) however the theory is the same in the user interface. It is easy to set up using the \"Cash for Coins\" template. Unlike other projects, this is not a promotion or vaporware. This software does exactly what it says it does. A lot of investors speculate on coins not even bothering to download the software and see the power of what it offers. This is what we are trying to fix. Get more people interested in caring about the technology and using it. This software has a full user interface and hundreds of little features exhaustively tested over the years. Something we know you will find awesome. There is absolutely nothing like this on the market.  Rising from the ashes! Our upcoming pegging system will force a stable price: *Unbreakable contracts (Peer to Peer no blockchain bloat) *Decentralized Anonymous Markets (Peer to Peer no blockchain bloat stronger than Tor) *Multisignature wallets with dual passwords hidden inside of PNG/JPG images using steganography *Automated Joint accounts and the ability to sign transactions with 2 computers (hard core security) *User Friendly Templates for contracts *Training videos *Ability to hide any file in an image *IMAP under the hood full integration with Email, automated negotiation of contracts *Price tracking so orders always maintain price *Bitmessage fully integraded decentralized email and markets *Translates to 92 languages using Google Translate *Unique change management system which breaks all the change into denominations *Easy to use accounting panel *Live Python Debugger, run the interpreter within the software *Advanced sending with multipay options *\"Pay To Email\" tipping system. Hide payments in images direct to email. *Everything is automated *Full Offer/Counter-Offer negotiation system. *Escrow panel with tons of options, anonymous chat *Feedback and reputation system, see how many contracts gained and lost *Serverless, everything is Peer to Peer *Decentralized moderation keys available to trusted users *Custom contracts and all kinds of contact options *Start your own market, completely anonymous *Cash for coins template *Custom contract template (can do anything you want if you are  familiar with it) Decentralized \"Local Bitcoins\": Send wires without the fear of theft due to Double deposit Decentralized exchange of cash for coins Buy/Sell anything without \"Empty Box Scam\" NO ARBITER NEEDED. It is self enforcing trade even with untrusted parties So it works like a decentralized trustless ebay... NO MIDDLEMEN, NO ESCROW NEEDED Works like decentralized Freelancer/Odesk Unbreakable Employee contracts. FORCE people to HONOR their word! No more unreliable employees, employers forced to pay as well. Barter ANYTHING. Use the coins only as self-assurance. Form a farm co-op trade Gold for Silver, Iron for Wheat. No need to use coins can decouple completely from currency. Some of the templates are still being worked on to make it \"Mom friendly\" so that it takes as few clicks as possible to form a contract. No need to think of \"terms and conditions\" contracts are anonymous and self-enforcing. Here is some of the features that we are working on in 2017: *Exotic spending... we will have the worlds first client to support time locks in the UI, deadmans switch and burn and parking and freezing coins all supported within the UI. *Cold Staking for both BitBay and BlackHalo... stake using two computers, impossible to hack. Its basically joint account staking *Custom Staking with Voting! Completely trustless voting and donations via staking. *Anti-Keylogger: A special on-screen keyboard to obliterate keyloggers once and for all. Even mouse movement loggers will be no match for this unless every movement is recorded *Tor and proxy options for internet requests *Buy/Sell template featuring multiple shipping options including a calculator and options to bill in escrow *Employment template featuring the ability for weekly reports and auto-payment within contract. Payments contingent on reports *Barter contract with amazing \"wish list\" where each item can be calculated converting kilograms to hours and ability to know exactly how many \"Avocados\" you need for a pound of \"Tomatoes\". Perfect for farming co-op in 3rd world countries. Perfect for trading used items! *Reverse auctions! Sellers bid for you the buyer *Normal Auctions... Ebay style decentralized auctions *Python contracts: Use the python interpreter to make contracts between peers. Pre-approved contracts potentially possible for verified devs and audited code on github. *API And more! The developer of BitBay (David Zimbeck) has been coding for years. He speaks with his software, always backing up his word. Unlike other developers he has never abandoned a project. The original founders of BitBay left the project and tried to blame him for their nefarious actions. Yet despite being cyberbullied and propagandized by the founders through the bitcointalk forum, 2 years later he STILL codes the software releasing many updates and a recent fork to POS 3.0. This is why we want you to test the software for yourself! The proof is in the actions!  Bitbay will be releasing a \"rolling peg\". This is basically a freezing/unfreezing inflation/deflation system that has the ability to create two asset classes \"frozen\" and \"liquid\". Based on voting, the supply can decrease or increase allowing a stable price in the markets and the ability to increase price without a market maker. If you want to be a part of the community, join our slack    If you've read this far, thanks for listening and we hope you will join us and learn how to use smart contracts!"

If you haven't already done so, now is the time for you as well. Make sure you back up your wallet.dat files! You can download new QT wallets from the OP or from bitbay.market The fork will take place on the 21st of January. \u00a0 There is no need to do anything on your part other than downloading and installing the new version of the QT. Everything else will be automated. Syncing up with the new version is a lot faster than previous versions, some of us are syncing 100% in around 8 - 9 hours. However, if you want a sync shortcut, feel free to download the blockchain file from bitbay.market  That boost file only works on the QT, not the client. A version for the client will come at a later date. Thanks for your support!"

Of course I can cover the remainder but figured we would ask here first if anyone wants to chip in. Even a small amount is thoughtful/helpful/appreciated. If the remainder isn't raised in a few days I will cover it. I think their services are very useful and we have never had an exclusive on Bitbay and its features before. And one thing the community complains about is the lack of PR/Marketing. If this one is successful we would have built a good relationship which is useful in the future. Here is the address: 1N7D4TcS6qSt5eQstMMKW8znE7hHxtgsid Also we have about 60% of the nodes on POS 3 fork, I still see some people have not updated. So anyone who has not updated their QT to the newest version on github.com/dzimbeck/bitbay or binaries at bitbay.market please do so. Also the markets build has been updated to 1.25 and all features tested on all operating systems. So we are doing well."

That is my opinion although do like the sys dev after accidentally calling him a spammer and copy cat before on this thread. I had no knowledge that their project was as old as bay. He seems quite an okay person with rapid coding skills he also speaks highly of david which is another classy aspect about him which I can appreciate and have since opened up a small space for some sys in my collection. I think fair value for that is 10M + hopefully it will realise this before our peg. I mean that price can be justified since why it is not worth at the least the same? then we all just need to work on adoption. I would think sys should be top 10 and bay should be top 5 if both projects reached completion. Of course there is strong competition at those levels so that may be seen as pipe dream by some."

The thing about sys and other projects is I respect any dev that does hard work and builds out their coin or software (Halo is software and not a coin). I think there is something to be said about spending time on open source software especially when there is no cash flow. Although some projects may be objectively/subjectively better than others, the devs that stand by their project and build it out as promised are okay in my book. Imagine how many devs start a project and leave it when it becomes less profitable."

After that it would gain at least some attention and additional usage. \u00a0Whales are not always for short term at all. Some btc whales adopt other worthy projects and keep with that project. Watching the bay market I see a lot of strong hands but many people are churning over for mini profits. It does look though like they keep buying in again with those profits so are gradually taking more bay off of the market.  whales could bring us to top 25 cmc and if you watch a lot of threads on the main alt board as I do long term hodlers mostly only look at the top 10 or top 20 for long term. People there asking for best coin under 1M cap are looking for quick profits in and out. When people start to use bay as an alternative to an exchange to get into crypto that will be usefull tool.  I am away currently and have not really had much time to use my main trading machines so ive not fired up the market place for a while.

        "I couldn't agree more. However there is a fast track to what you want and a slow track. With the slow track you are risking more competition and possible copy cat teams outpacing us. Bay lacks only user base and raw development speed. David is obviously a fantastic coder/designer and person. With a team behind him to do the things he can delegate tasks we would may be finished by now and even adding a lot of extra features. A lot of whales out there are not pump and dumpers only. They are invested in the entire crypto scene and many other areas. Many own all the top crypto news sites and many many other very useful tools to a crypto project. \u00a0Along with the pegging which stops whale dumping damage and control. If we had had a couple of influential whales with us that believed in the project from the start who knows where bay could be now.  So many inferior projects beat down much better projects through their contacts and financial backing. Luckily for us there is nothing exactly like bay out there (yet and hopefully not for a while) so we can may be keep on with the pace we are and still eventually reach the heights the project deserves to reach on pure merit without getting copied and over taken. \u00a0I though would not at all mind a serious whale or two to give us a leg up to some decent converage, and a more sensible price so that we can fund all kinds of things even now bay at 1000 -20000 sats. Really to just take off a bit of the constant churning volume would be amazing. If I had even a spare 250 BTC I think bay would soar in market cap and interest in the community. It would spiral. So many churners between 100 and 200 sats it's bogging us down. Suretha if we increase our userbase then these churners will be forced up higher and higher. It's great to be firmly inside the top 100 though and I hope minimum bay will be firm and stable in the top 20 by the end of the year even at this slowly slowly market penetration rate.  The people that destroyed the project were not really whales as such they were more scammers that are now whales since they extracted their btc from this project and dumped their bays destroying both the development fund and the bay market for years with dumping it down over and over. I have no doubt david will create one of if not the best project on this board the issue is everyone else is watching and trying to outpace us. Hence why before I suggested another ICO months ago ( i see now many projects have done this) to get attention (people will examine the marketplace and the pegging in detail before investing garnering a lot of attention and likely a lot of publications and free marketing) I guess the time for this idea has passed now since people are a bit jaded on ICOs and especially 2nd ICO's. Failing that the financial support and connections some BTC whales have (these connections are vast and create a lot of buzz and marketing) could have really boosted us forward.  Anyway everything is going great as it is so this is a positive time for BAY and success will come either rapidly or steadily. I'm not even considering looking at opening my cold wallets until top10. Even then only if it is essential and I need funds for anything specific. I'm hoping with a decentralised market place and no need at all for centralised enforcement or penalties along with the peg this could and should be massive. \u00a0With just a few highly reliable bay merchants for inputting fiat then the entire thing is self sufficient and has crazy potential. I know some regard it as a pipe dream but even a 1 or 10Bn market cap is not at all large for such possibilities.... only time is the factor for bay and will others try to clone and beat us to the end."

Nobody outside of this thread thinks that about bay and most here quietly assume that bay will not be there anytime soon ( although I disagree) so that is not pulling people into or causing people to hold bay. Bay is being held and rising for different reasons. Although bay suffers from people that have never looked into it just watching it churn between 100 and 180 sats and love trying to grab profit. Be good to see that break out of there soon although it is attractive for bittrex so we won't get a delisting like a lot of other coins on there and polo make take note if the volume goes to a steady 50 BTC a day.\u00a0 For such a massive ICO waves sometimes is not doing much more volume today just 37 btc ( i'm not putting waves down at all I have not looked into it much).

To me that is quite a lot but some people (real whales may have far more) \u00a0I have just noticed this almost exactly 2M and 1M \u00a0blocks being placed with spacing between 50 and 100 sats ahead of the current price for a while. I see a few 1M + road blocks up to 300sats then nothing really in terms of bulk amount of bay for sale right up to 5k sats. \u00a0I guess it could just be random people taking profits. \u00a0Still I would love to see a new whale just gobble up that 10 M of coins under 300 sats in one go who really sees the future value of bay. the point about the polo form is very interesting.  anyway it's all good we are gaining interest in the community - I notice a few new faces suggesting bay as a good project when people pose the question on the main alt board."

This update was important for three BitBay exclusive features. \u00a0 1. \u00a0 \u00a0Voting \u0096 BitBay\u0092s Proof of Stake 3.0 (PoS) update increased security, and also implemented the ability for Miners to vote with their shares. \u00a0Who is a miner? \u00a0You are if you are staking. \u00a0You will be able to vote on many important decisions with your stake in BAY, including the price direction once the rolling price peg is completed later this year. \u00a0In addition, a new Voting Tab will allow you to easily decide what to do with the votes you have. 2. \u00a0 \u00a0Cold Staking \u0096 While not fully active in this update, important changes for Cold Staking have been added in the background. \u00a0If you are a BitBay user, you know there are two highly secure keys for your wallet. \u00a0Cold Staking will give you the ability to put these two keys on separate computers. \u00a0To break into your wallet the hacker would need to access both computers and break both keys. \u00a0Good luck! 3. \u00a0 \u00a0Checklocktimeverify \u0096 This feature allows you to automate what happens in the future with your coins. \u00a0Set it up to send coins tomorrow to another wallet. \u00a0You can use it for burning (parking) coins and retrieve them at a later date for additional security. \u00a0Schedule what you want to happen with your BAY even when you aren\u0092t going to be there to make it happen. BitBay has increased in value considerably in the first three weeks of 2017 as more people take notice. \u00a0We invite you to try the already working BitBay Client and will give you 1000 BAY for installing it and accepting the Contract out there waiting for you right now. \u00a0Please visit the BitBay team using the links below. \u00a0There is almost always someone on our Slack available to help you through any issues and help you collect your first 1000 BAY.

They could run a botnet too and try to control most of the network. But by and large that is not the fault in Bitmessage. The same problem exists with TOR too. Perhaps someone will solve encrypted IP (Demonsaw was doing something new?). Most likely humanity will NEED 3d printers that can make electronics to completely save themselves. That way they can print cellphones, radio receivers and mesh networks. Until the government starts triangulating those signals and killing their own citizens? Who knows, but we need to do what we can for our freedom. In a dystopia expect anything that frees people to be made illegal. In many countries you can't even own your own land. In USA you can't collect rainwater, feed the homeless(in Florida) or sell raw milk(even though 90% of the world sells raw milk and its better for you). It has gotten absurd. I'm surprised they don't charge for air. Apparently with Obamacare you have to pay to exist (forced health insurance under the threat of jail). Oh how he \"cares\" so much about us.

        "I'm not sure its possible to outlaw p2p. Think how many connections are made via direct IP. It doesn't make sense. I guess they could flag IP addresses they know use p2p networks but that is sort of weird because that could effect those same IP addresses for other things. They could have web providers limit bandwidth to only certain networks but then users can still use various methods of encrypted data transfer on top of that, \"social cryptography\" Even if they could outlaw p2p, that is a long ways away. There is also encrypted tcp maybe something like Demonsaw?  I'm not sure I understand how demonsaw works though... I realize they make it look like regular web traffic but why can't that be detected by an attacker? If they know the encryption or have the software can they identify hosts or routers? I think again mesh networks are the BEST way to go so the key is to focus on these problems and solve them before we are stopped from using p2p. But like I've said the government has their hands full chasing their own tail. And nobody with common sense trusts them anymore(I've eliminated all media and beliefs from my life to defend against it). Its really the worlds only problem (government bullshit and propaganda) Its really a serious problem. People need to start learning about radio and mesh networks so we can simply bypass ALL telcom. This means cellphones need to be turned into routers first of all. Actually funny thing about that! Most cellphone companies don't allow tethering! Some of the phones need to be rooted to do it. Although I think USB tether is always possible. The point is cellphones must be 3d printed, routers 3d printed. Small \"satellite\" systems using 3d printed solar powered balloons and repeaters (maybe hidden in plain sight) Everything needs to be 3d printed to finally destroy the monster that is the media. The media should be extinct, its a billion times more important than \"decentralized money\". And controlling the internet is already being done! They are usually a few steps ahead of the citizens. You can't get honest search results in google, almost every subject taught in \"school\" is false (and I mean no exceptions, it really is all deliberately deceptive). Okay sure there are exceptions in basic math and basic engineering. But even the worlds best patents are suppressed so we get taught 2nd rate engineering too. And our math is horribly structured with paradoxical thinking (axiom of choice, nonsense irrational numbers). True math is \"finitism\" as per example by Norman Wildberger When we have 3d printers that can rotate materials, we can open source electronics and end the ridiculousness of suppressed technology. So thats my rant on that subject. I don't see p2p being outlawed any time soon but the media has got to go. People should subvert telcom altogether and come up with a true mesh network that can never be shut down. Realize if there was a big war or they shut down the internet Bitcoin will go down with it. As for the staking, yes it WILL be available before pegging. Actually its the next update! With a bunch of other features and it might include advanced payments. It depends if I finish this update soon I can do it in two small updates or one big one. Paypal some people have done it, if you do \"cash for coins\" you will see it is NOT recommended as a payment method. The recommended payment methods are cash deals with western union and moneygram etc. If you want to avoid chargebacks in Paypal, hold their funds for 30 days or until they message Paypal saying that the deal went through fairly and they will not chargeback."

Yes paypal is super risky, I think you can withdraw funds after a few days if you have a verified account so that could be an option but you risk getting the account closed if they say they never got what they ordered. Does it matter if they send it as a gift? or can they get around that by saying the account was hacked and funds spent without permission. Anyway we need to replace paypal eventually with BAY so it's not a big deal.   instant bank transfer is best for now.

They need to be able to print a cellphone with the case in one print to make it viable for the lazy consumer. Craig was the one who got me interested in the magic of graphene. Also I don't mean to be preachy about government, it's just that getting off the grid allows us to master everything. It lowers our resource footprint, it reduces the amount we consume, it increases quality of life and it ensures that our childrens children will always have a home. It's not just an investment that pays off in this lifetime but in every life that follows it. Products that literally last 100s of years. Cars should have been electric, compressed air, water powered, or biodiesel with no friction using electromagnetic or hydraulic parts, infinite gear transmissions, foam filled tires and other things. Actually I will share something with you guys that I work on part time. It's a spreadsheet with all of the worlds best tech. I'm trying to get the most level and unbiased opinion on these techs and more importantly their costs and time investments and hidden drawbacks. Also I'm exploring solutions to each tech. For example in construction, there are things like tire homes, buried grain silos, CEB, aircrete, 3d printed concrete etc. The key is to find a solution that helps the poorest people in the world get off the grid in a good way. Then have solutions for lower class, and lastly middle class. Then we do like an \"editors choice\" where we award the best tech in each category. Lastly there is \"future tech\" which is things that can't be bought easily or in every country or something we think we be the \"future solution\" like airships with for transportation for example or 3d printed dirt/cob homes. Then it gets open sourced on a website. Check this out..."

How about spray concrete? Same principle. And fiberglass boat building which has existed for many years. Mix resin and hardener at the nozzle and spray successive layers onto a waxed wood frame. Spray enough layers and you have a solid boat hull, same with the individual parts. Seems to me it's only a matter of scale to print micro electronics and houses.

In Mexico we have very cheap labor so if you pay by the tire like a dollar a tire you will get your house built and a very large one built for a couple thousand. For a few hundred per wall spray on stucco for a nice finish and protect against offgassing. My other favorites on the list are Expandable Chinese Shipping Container homes that slide out in both directions. You can get a set of 2 houses for 5,000 USD and each one is 15 ft by 20 ft roughly. Shipping was about 1500 or so. Also I like Cob 3d dirt printing. I also dedicated an entire section to aircrete and i can see it being mixed with flyash(which is recycled). You can mix with hemp for ultra strength. The aircrete was so inspirational that I bought the machine and have had long talks with the guy from Gibran center.  Compressed earth bricks are great but they need to cure for a few weeks. Unless you buy the very expensive horizontal press and those can and should be dry stacked because they are uniform height. Interlocking bricks is a gimmick use rebar instead. I think if you've got 20k the horizontal press pays for itself. I think that is the one that makes uniform bricks. Earth bags are good but getting those very long bags is actually hard to find and not as cheap as it looks. It requires a little research. But those are some of the best ones. However they are all so exciting and this research will take me a year to finish. I'm trying to find a clear \"winner\". Tires is definitely up near the top. But CEB 3d printing Aircrete Cob and inflatable forms are also very interesting. Dirt homes have the best advantages for insulation being resistant to pests and being free and locally sourced. Which also makes underground options interesting if a flooding technique is found that is cheap."

        "That's cool it sounds like at least you keep yourself busy. Yes I'm still developing BlackHalo. There are differences. blackhalo/bithalo is multicoin BitBay is similar to Blackcoin for now although it will have pretty major differences when I finish the rolling peg. The client has changed a lot. I've coded the world's first decentralized markets, unbreakable contracts, etc. There is a pretty long feature list with things like steganography, pay to email, automated joint accounts , price tracking, automatic translation to 92 languages, and a bunch of other things. The history since BLK is definitely a long read if you are like TLDR then basically what happened was I was asked to project manage BitBay by BTER and a few others who quickly abandoned the project with what they raised and tried to drag me through the mud. Of course I stayed and mapped out a rolling peg feature that can revitalize any coin by controlling and freezing supply. I still work on Blackcoin too however I've got less control since that coin is technically someone elses. I was going to do decentralized exchange with a microtrader in BLK called NightTrader but that is on hold because i think it would be too slow and consist of too many transactions per trade (Bitcoin is very slow). And I've been coding a couple years on this project and will be working the rest of 2017 to see everything finally completed. It's cool to see the stuff you are working on, dev work is pretty big workload indeed."

        "Yeah I hold my license in California, did several deals during the collapse. It taught me a lot about how almost nothing I read in my books applied to reality. I think the best business model for real estate brokers is \"find and assign\" although I never tried it, it's very similar to being a lead aggrigator but you get a higher cut and no liability. It's basically referrals but better. But honestly there is way more potential in building homes in 3rd world countries. The USA is a tight margin with limited options unless you are a millionaire. Also did work for Dakota Land Services as a landsmen. I did easements and charting out fiber optic and oil lines. The job was amazing, it paid like 350 a day. I only held that job for a few months though. It was the exact same time I got into crypto and bought Litecoin. I got fired because I made my female managers jealous by coding a program to type the easements using winautomation and other programs. It was my first time ever trying to code anything. I made something to parse addresses in Python and that's how I picked up coding. It was funny because with that software I finished a job that normally takes weeks in one day and got fired for it. I guess that's office politics for you. You see even though it saves the company millions, the employees get paid more the longer they procrastinate. So doing the job too fast is bad for business even though the boss can make the difference in his cut. When I saw the Litecoin market crash after going from 2 dollars to 50 I had the idea for Halo because the Chinese were complaining that there was no way to buy Bitcoin. So I realized double deposit could solve their problems. Unfortunately, I should have sold the Litecoin and just bought whatever random altcoins i could find since everything was pumping no matter how random the coin was. But I was new to trading, I was such a n00b I thought the order book was the history of buys and sales. But eventually I figured it out and started coding Halo. Actually I had the idea for Halo the same day I got fired and my friend was talking to me over the phone and was like \"you should quit your job and do that\". Go figure."

Chief shows up and says \"Here, make this work, you know about electronics\" Sure, I was a radio tech, not a programmer. A couple months later the dept had a run reporting system, Novell Network (ELS 1), record keeping and equipment databases and I had some new skills (ADA, Basic, C++ & Turbo Pascal) Got the bug for going on line to BBS's and started one for the department (InfoNet) Long story short, a few years down the road, retired and started an Internet provider company that went national before we sold it. Been working and playing in the industry ever since. Got the crypto bug in '13 and now takes up most of my free time but, so far, it's been worth it. Just don't get as much exercise as I should now! My wife was also a coder (and Paramedic), worked for the FAA and was on the team that developed the TCAS (Traffic Collision Avoidance System) for aircraft that went online in 1989.

Thats why I will probably move into farming or construction when finished here. Its just that the tools we have here in BitBay are too tempting to finish. I forsee my involvement in crypto beyond this more at the business end, like crypto replacing stocks that sort of thing. I think I mentioned that in my interview. A company paying percentage of profits to investors automated on the blockchain publishing everything to be completely transparent. Anyways, by the way I sent the first draft of our article out to the core slack team and my friend Johanna at Bitcoinbuzz. So just so you know that will be published soon when thats all edited.

The private markets in Bay can not be moderated unless a mod knows the exact name of the market. So in theory a black market could evolve there.

I mean if you create a decentralised market place then how would you ever be able to moderate it all all or is there a special provision for this that I don't understand?

        "We can't stop private escrow. Only listings. If a buyer and seller are in escrow they control their funds, banning a user cannot ban them from contracts, only posting illegal things in the main market. Contracts cannot be interfered with, its impossible because its peer to peer. Also things that are illegal in one country but not another are probably going to be allowed. So if a person sells Hemp or Raw Milk which is illegal in USA but legal in South America, then they are responsible for their own order. We won't moderate Mein Kampf for example.  However if someone offering out something like a hitman contract obviously that has to be removed. I'm pretty sure thats a fair moderation policy for the main markets. Also, I'm not responsible for the contents of the markets. This project is open source. If someone thinks I'm responsible I will gladly give them the moderation key they can then accept the responsibility. I'm not interested in babysitting the markets. It is impossible to \"control the entire internet\". That is a fruitless way to spend my time. How can you moderate what you can't see? If someone encrypts porn to the Bitcoin blockchain is everyone in the world committing a crime by downloading it? Each country is going to police their citizens and generally try to rob them of as much freedom as possible before they realize it(so they have the illusion of freedom). However, these markets are obviously international. BitBay was started in China by Steven Dai. So is America going to interfere because the dev is american?? That doesn't make sense. I don't even get paid in USD. Heck I don't even get paid. Thats the same as throwing Satoshi in jail for making Bitcoin (even though Satoshi is just a pseudonym for a large group). It might happen but it is a violation of all that is good in the world a price I would gladly pay. If it really boils down to that. The creator of reddit unfortunately met a similar fare. Sadly he took his own life before the \"stupidest trial in the world\" took place. It happens. A life lost in pursuit of all that is good. Source:  So it is what it is. We will do the best we can to moderate what we see, I'm not legally responsible for it but we do it out of goodwill. We want the masses to take an interest in their own freedom and start looking at distributed networks and decentralized markets. For their own benefit. Its a much, much larger picture."

        "A contract that is already taken by someone disappears from the market and can thus not be moderated. The harder part of your question is \"what if you were buying something that was not obviously wrong\" There are a lot of things that are legal in some countries or context, but illegal in others. It is not possible for a moderator to know the law in all countries. Some drugs are a good example of this problem. We are still trying to make guidelines for this, but it's obvious that we will never get this 100% right. The logical thing is to run a rather strict policy in the open market, and be less vigorous with private markets that limit themself to things that are legal in parts of the world. Very good point. No moderation would be the easy solution. The problem is that we are leading this development. That means criminal elements could be very tempted to use our market for their purposes, and thus constitute a threath to BitBay's chances to become a major player for legal goods. There are other coins that are trying to develop what we have. Some of them are signaling that they intend to target black markets. We have to assume that one or more of them will succeed at some point in time. When that time comes, moderation may become less of an issue. But I agree this is a difficult one. Suggestions how to handle this are very welcome. I agree. But who says David will be a moderator? The answer to those questions are somewhat contained in the above answers I think. We will try to run it without incentives for moderators. If that does not work, we will have to address it. We believe the number of moderators doesn't have to be high because users can report bad stuff. And because, as I said above, we think a coin that targets black markets will take most of that traffic in the future"

It's not like we can't continue to program this protocol after David completes the core.  Heck BitBay is designed to add innovation. BitBay is one of the first few coins to have decentralized voting built into the Client UI. And probably the first that is actually user friendly. The future possibilities with that will be mind blowing.  Hell... Bitcoin will take another 10 years to never before they can agree to implement something like that. Currently there is one default marketplace that everyone is connected to - and that's the >BitBay< market.  So if we get into a snag with conflicts of laws pertaining to different countries, then by all means create a new market based on that country's laws i.e., >China BitBay< or >France BitBay< , etc. Then anyone who posts on it and moderates it will be based on that countries laws. No need to fret over this. There is no reason the Client can't be programmed to make everyone happy (or at least the vast majority) - unlike Bitcoin. We've yet to really grasp all the possibilities that custom python programmable contracts will provide and help support us in future design-build protocols."

I of course hope bitbay will never be spoiled with the stuff some people like to buy. However, I think moderation should be 100% decentralised too. So there is no point of focus for blame or recriminations. We are creating a software that allows you to sell things on the internet we should not be held liable for what people choose to sell. The legal side is simply you don't list things that are illegal to sell in your country and you don't offer for sale to those countries it is illegal to purchase. The onus is on them not on the moderators. They (the user) are responsible for using the software in accordance with the laws the onus is on them. They must do their own DD. I think making too many guides and rules specifically is going to be pretty tough. I guess decentralised flagging and removal/remain voting is the best way to go. It is then on those people to keep bay free of stuff that can crush it's reputation."

        "1. Currently there is only one competitor equivalent to David's Halo tech, and what I mean by equivalent is that it is trustless.  Shadowcash has also decided to utilize trustless escrow. I don't know how far along they are with their Client UI though, they will have limitations compared to Davids design, and I don't know how they will be able to match any rolling peg tech similar to BitBay, because anon tech has its setbacks when it comes to adding new features to it. David's Halo Tech Client UI currently works for BitBay, Bitcoin, and Blackcoin. \u00a0So as far as I know those are the only 4 coins that have trustless setup built into the Client UI. BitBay's main difference will be that it will include a rolling peg to remove the volatility factor that plagues cryptocurrencies and thus hindering adoption from merchants. Most merchants can't afford to lose profit on their sales so they immediately transfer any crypto transaction back to fiat. With BitBay's rolling peg stabilizing price, yet still allowing for price movement, \u00a0we hope to eliminate this final piece missing from the puzzle for mass adoption for merchants!  2. The tech is decentralized. If you want ownership you can buy the coin. After David completes the core build we will continue innovating because he also designed the first \"user friendly\" decentralized voting system built into the client! However, it's only fair that the more coins you own the more voting power you get. But the point is that we will not become stuck in gridlock like Bitcoin currently is. It seems Bitcoin is at a point where they will only change when it means life or death. BitBay's voting system is mainly based on determining the pegged value of the coin, yet it can be used for anything. For example, imagine in the future we have a team of developers, and the community makes a list of innovations they want added to the coin - we'd simply announce a vote for what innovation should take precedence over the others and then have the developers get to work on it! So the gridlock enigma Bitcoin faces will not be an issue for us in the future! edit: And unlike Bitcoin - since BitBay is Proof of Stake, we actually have a much more lucrative ability to fund future developers! Hope this helps!"

If you want to walk away from a project you don't take the development funding with you. Only Dai himself would employ this reasoning? are you Dai? What level of funding do they really have? perhaps it's just the 200 BTC they owe BITBAY plus whatever they dumped their bitbay coins for? even if they roped some others in and have huge funding that does not mean they are aware of who they are dealing with.  There is no way a proven fraudster can be trusted to run a multi million dollar ICO. Looks like BITBAY2 blah blah ex ali ba ba on chinese exchanges (cant use bter now) wanting to dominate huge chunks of the minting they retain 49%? bitcoin whales and now a billionaire involved.... are any of those names chinese for bob surplus ? If they have billionaires and huge btc whales all in on this why they want to extract a few more btc from us on here. that forbes article reads like a bitbay2 \u00a0blueprint... 2017 version. I think this entire community has had enough of scammers taking their BTC and pissing in their face. I mean imagine taking the BTC for our dev fund then instead of just leaving us alone and taking our investment for funding development they hang around for years dumping their FREE bitbay dumping down on the market to make sure the price can never rise. This person is a pariah for good now. Changing his name says it all. I don't even think this scam has broken out properly to the community yet. Wait until it does it will be big news."

Hide payments in images direct to email. *Everything is automated *Full Offer/Counter-Offer negotiation system. *Escrow panel with tons of options, anonymous chat *Feedback and reputation system, see how many contracts gained and lost *Serverless, everything is Peer to Peer *Decentralized moderation keys available to trusted users *Custom contracts and all kinds of contact options *Start your own market, completely anonymous *Cash for coins template *Custom contract template (can do anything you want if you are  familiar with it) Implications of DDE(Double Deposit Escrow) Smart Contracts and their use cases: Decentralized \"Local Bitcoins\": Send wires without the fear of theft due to Double deposit Decentralized exchange of cash for coins Buy/Sell anything without \"Empty Box Scam\" NO ARBITER NEEDED. It is self enforcing trade even with untrusted parties So it works like a decentralized trustless ebay... NO MIDDLEMEN, NO ESCROW NEEDED Works like decentralized Freelancer/Odesk Unbreakable Employee contracts. FORCE people to HONOR their word! No more unreliable employees, employers forced to pay as well. Barter ANYTHING. Use the coins only as self-assurance. Form a farm co-op trade Gold for Silver, Iron for Wheat. No need to use coins can decouple completely from currency. Some of the templates are still being worked on to make it \"Mom friendly\" so that it takes as few clicks as possible to form a contract. No need to think of \"terms and conditions\" contracts are anonymous and self-enforcing. Here is some of the features that we are working on in 2017: *Exotic spending... we will have the worlds first client to support time locks in the UI, deadmans switch and burn and parking and freezing coins all supported within the UI. *Cold Staking for both BitBay and BlackHalo... stake using two computers, impossible to hack. Its basically joint account staking *Custom Staking with Voting! Completely trustless voting and donations via staking. *Anti-Keylogger: A special on-screen keyboard to obliterate keyloggers once and for all.

Payments contingent on reports *Barter contract with amazing \"wish list\" where each item can be calculated converting kilograms to hours and ability to know exactly how many \"Avocados\" you need for a pound of \"Tomatoes\". Perfect for farming co-op in 3rd world countries. Perfect for trading used items! *Reverse auctions! Sellers bid for you the buyer *Normal Auctions... Ebay style decentralized auctions *Python contracts: Use the python interpreter to make contracts between peers.

Imagine peer to peer automated contracts for trustless binary options trading, trustless internet lottery, advertising campaigns where websites utilize BitBay's steganography features to add coupons built-into their website! It is completely free to use! So the competition like eBay, amazon, alibaba, etc., will never be able to match the prices that merchants can offer - all the while the merchants will be making more profit! The rolling peg will provide one of the most entertaining trading systems on the internet that will provide futures markets for frozen coins along side the liquid coin market.  This could leads towards trade wars between investors, mining pools, speculators, and merchant guilds, all trying to dictate which way the market moves!  And with decentralized voting built into the Client UI, not only can investment groups try to manipulate price through the exchanges, but also through the voting protocol. And the best part about it all is that the goal of the rolling peg is to provide stability. This will entice much more conservative capital to invest in it! It truly is a work of art! David Zimbeck has an amazing mind on him. He really is solving the last piece of the puzzle in regards to removing the middleman from the equation!"

Regardless, myself and many others positively identify him since we know him in person. He can call himself Bigfoot he would still be the same guy who never lifted a finger for us while we shed blood sweat and tears to build this software. Scammer doesn't even do it justice. What he did to us was so bad there isn't a word in the dictionary worth using to describe it. It was legendary everyone in Bitcoin knew about it. As for evidence well, there is more chat logs on BCT for that one than any other project. We only defended Dai for a small time with the hopes that he would do the right thing and support the project he started. I would spam him with Skype messages emails and phone calls to get a very rare response once every few months. Unfortunately the 2 years we left the door open he was expending his energy in Qtum instead of the project that netted him 200BTC and more than 10% of free BitBay (20% if you count what he got when it dumped). Then him and Lin sell on our heads while we sacrifice years of our lives to build BitBay. It wasn't the only time he had been involved in a scandal either. He was a serial scammer with Bob going from project to project. It's a joke for them to defend him. There is nothing to defend. Calling it \"paid fud\" is not a wise decision either considering this is definitely not \"fud\" and we would never have the money to pay for it lol... hell everyone knows how we spend here. Just recent PR with Bitcoinbuzz, small things. Sometimes people do fud. This ain't one of those times. \u00a0 Most the people commenting there are from other coins and bitcoin and investors and such. Very few people known as regulars here in our main thread. I did notice a couple and of course their voices should be heard. We were all seriously effected they have every right to speak out. Of course we have asked that most of core leave the issue alone so we don't relive the past. There is nothing in it for us to \"fud\" anyone, of course we have never done that before. We don't \"fud\" Ethereum or anyone not even our competitors SYS and SDC. We speak nicely of them. This is different of course, we hope that they stop their ico completely. Dai already has tons of money he doesn't need more and he can burn his bitcoins for all we care. Anyone thinking of investing in that is probably better off sending their BTC to \"6a\" lol. We are busy doing good PR, publishing articles and I've got an update coming out this week and have no time for it. It is a circus to watch it though. Can't help but feel bad for everyone else involved."

        "BitBay\u0092s newest updates to their decentralized Smart Client are scheduled for release in March. The updates include many features to make your Marketplace experience both more secure and user friendly. Cold Staking will be introduced to allow you to keep your keys on two different systems, making your account virtually unhackable. For even more security, a new Anti-Keylogger will keep anyone from recording the keystrokes used to enter your password. The Marketplace Client will now Stake your coins, so your BAY can earn interest while being used in Contracts for buying, selling, and securing your purchases as intended. This feature is the last to be moved over from the Wallet to the Client, and eliminates the need for you to have a BitBay QT wallet altogether. These three new features, as well as the many others listed below, are all being added since the last major release in January. BitBay continues to deliver a product, while other digital currency projects deliver only promises. * Font sizes in pixels instead of points since PyQt4 has no DPI adjustment for UI * Made clear key location on Exit * Added Proxy/Tor option * Added Email login on account loading to protect password * Added ability to filter other currencies * Added way to activate debug file from UI * Added custom splash screen for Halo coins * AOL/Outlook typo fixed, removed support for Mail.com due to change in their programming * Enhanced user interface, various fixes * Detected when users move keys from known location * Added generic encryption for sensitive data in temporary files * Fixed balance float * Fixed sorting and interface with the markets table * Encrypt/Decrypt functions added in the menu * Sign/Verify functions added in the menu * Allowed for Staking across multiple multi-signature accounts * Added Voting * Updated pastebin url * Fixed Email encoding/padding issues"

Its time we could spend marketing and showing new people how to do smart contracts and use the decentralized markets and search for bugs. It's sad to say but I cannot change the evil in the hearts of men. I can only destroy the evil in my own heart.

Steven/Patrick and the other original founders took hundreds of thousands of dollars in Bitcoins with them, and using that money went on to start new projects.\u00a0 They took millions of BitBay with them as well. What did BitBay gain from this? Losing the toxic presence of these founders has allowed progress to be made without the focus being on greed.\u00a0 There are no arguments over what should be the goal, and without any money in the funds, there is no debate over how it should be spent.\u00a0 There is only progress. David continues to work on BitBay and deliver updates regularly.\u00a0 Even people invested in BAY have no idea of the potential once the rolling peg is integrated... but none of us have any doubt it will be completed because David is still here after everything working on his dream, and we see what he has done so far. David does this work knowing it can only increase the value of BAY the original founders are still selling.\u00a0 He is actually increasing the value of the assets they stole because he believes what he is doing is important, and sees the bigger picture when it is complete. More good news for BAY owners is Craig's research shows the original founders are almost completely out of BAY to sell.\u00a0 Of the tens of millions taken, they are down to the end of their stash.\u00a0 When they stop selling, the price suppression we have seen for so long will stop.\u00a0 Buying BAY will actually increase the price again.\u00a0 One day, not long from now, the thieves are going to look at the BAY price and wonder how they could have thrown away the fortune they would have had. BitBay has gained so much from the departure of Dai and the rest of the founders.\u00a0 The only reason we have the ability today to buy BAY at these prices when the technology is so advanced is because these guys are keeping it low.\u00a0 I have mine... and I can't wait for them to run out of ammunition."

So I'm not against talking about it as long as people are made very aware of what has been done here despite them. When people see that we work here continually testing updates and fulfilling promises with all that garbage on our heads, they will realize why this is worth it. Simply, tell people even after what happened 2 years of work and download the software and see for themselves! We aren't trying to convert people from other coins. But there is no reason not to highlight that point. As for the slack research you are probably right. Because if any of them still had coins, now would definitely be the time they would sell them. Unless they secretly believe in this project haha. I think they were foolish to sell, they were not even paying attention to the ideas. Of course BitBay is already up 4-5 times over the year because it is undeniable that there is more going on here than meets the eye. \"Never judge a book by its cover\""

        "I want to make an official statement here: I've switched from Google translate in the LIVE translator because mean ol' Google decided they wanted to prevent web crawlers and bots so they crushed our goslate Python package that I was using. So what does this mean? It means we had to switch to Yandex. It means the list of languages is slightly different too. Which means the thing changed and anyone who is working on translations will probably have to start over! Sorry to break that news. But its okay lesson learned! This time we have to do translate them ahead of time using the LIVE translator so we can archive them just in case this one gets taken out too(also because Yandex has an API key that limits us to 10 million characters per month). Only ONE person will be assigned to this. It will be a bounty. So I will urge others to only use the language you   for now and not play around with translation too much or I have to get another key. Okay lastly, the build is done. I put off a few other minor fixes to the next release. Since I know how long everyone has waited for this specific update (cold stake). So I'm building it tonight/tomorrow checking it and we release on slack for the first tests. And actually anyone can test it by downloading the updater manually. Otherwise the version number will change when slack decides. They had some date in March set. We could roll it back a little earlier even if the tests go well."

        "Sure it's pretty simple actually. So most coins only stake normal single ket QT accounts. Blackcoin dev rat4 made me a series of improvements in POS 3 that allow me to spend with block signing key. Therefore, any input can stake now. This means multisig can stake. Aka multisignature staking. So if multisinature can stake then you can use two computers to stake in sort of a two step send. Aka cold staking. So you have a local network at home. You have two computers. Computer A finds a stake, signs it, sends to computer B who signs it with their 2nd key sends back to A who sends the complete TX to the network! This lets you stake with only one key connected. Thus your account is extremely hard to hack since your keys are on two completely different computers. The 2nd location can be a server thus is perfect for exchanges and banks. The 2nd key can be a little staking device. Lastly the innovation in POS 3 although simple is crucial for letting us stake with frozen coins. The custom stake makes voting easier too as we can customize our payments and even donate our stakes or park them. Those are the nice things about simply being allowed to stake via spending with block singing key embedded in the TX as opposed to limiting us to single key stake."

As you all know with online and network games there is low latency. And actually the question is moreso how often you check to see if you have won. Rat4 recommend it's redundant to check more than every 16 seconds. But in Halo/Bitbay we check every 7. So perhaps that even gives us a tiny advantage. Also, because of the p2sh stake it lets our frozen coins stake which helps our chances of finding one in the first place. So unless your server lags there is no major difference."

I'm not saying extremely fast computers similar to speeds boasted by Quantum computing won't happen either. They most likely will. However I don't think the key to breaking BTC will be in brute force computing, it will be in breakthroughs in math and logic.

So measuring light in a \"vacuum\" would be almost exponentially faster. So whatever space agencies claim lights speed is in a vacuum must be untrue, they are probably even lying. The light speed record has been \"broken\" scientists find convenient excuses to explain away the results as usual. It falls into the realm of pseudoscience. The reality is quite simple. Light is not a constant, thats the part being lied about. Measuring in air shows the speed we are given except air is extremely dense filled with tons of elements (light of course moves slower in water and other materials with higher refractive index). So experiments show already circumstantial evidence that there is something seriously wrong with the theories. Thus excuses are given to make our text books fit their models. Students must not question authority! As you can see I'm not a fan of Einstein.

        "Also the markets are more active here, the community works much harder, helps me test, helps market, it has a more marketable brand name, is a more active slack and unlike Blackcoin I have much more control over the coins protocol. Distribution may be a bit better too. I'm not knocking BLK, I develop in both. However the rolling peg is at least one feature that will set this apart. And if we decide to add other features (like zcoins) we can do that as well. I don't control BLK github. However because BlackHalo is dual coin I also use it to store my Bitcoin using BitHalo. Also their dev janko is very active working on colored coins and Java based applications. So they have their own thing going for them. They do alot of proof of stake enhancing.

Then I need templates done and finally the API after that it will be very historic as Halo will be complete. Then pegging. First will come a demo client that enforces pegging on the client level. That way we can simulate it a bit test it and get a feel for what is coming and the user experience. Then comes a lite daemon simply for exchanges to check accounts and do basic API accounting. Then we test on the network for real and do the fork. At about that same time we need an exchange. So you guys have time, don't worry. There will be several updates potentially one for each template. It depends on how fast I can get each template done."

        "We here is a few things to understand first. When I started, it was in BitHalo. I needed a protocol that was cross-platform. Double deposit escrow was designed to liberate a lot of people and industries. It had to be cross-platform. At the time, I was the only person in the world coding actual real world implementations, specifically software implementations that was NOT an altcoin. In fact, this is why it was so hard to get me to do a coin in the first place as I didn't ever intend to be a pumper or a fundraiser. My implementation into Blackcoin was for speed, POS which was better than POW and the multipool interested me. I hold like 300k Black which isn't much. Obviously I'm way more invested here not only in money but in time. 2 years exclusively marketing BitBay. Now consider that BitHalo being the media darling has a good reason to be branded as it is the only software in the world to do contracts on the Bitcoin blockchain. However its slow. Nobody wants to wait a day for confirmations. Also, I had to make a solution in Bitcoin because the crazy Bitcoin foundation can't even frikkin agree on blocksize. So enter BitBay, I was put in a project and have definitely found myself taking it over and have full control over the github. This is a very big deal. I can't change Blackcoin Github and to be honest, when I discussed the BlackHalo software... I was crudely told I was coding \"in an echo chamber\". Its been fairly hard to make progress there. But I don't want to pull support for them either and so why wouldn't I not fix bugs for the software itself? A lot of my updates this year were performance updates. Every single piece of marketing, branding, time, energy, community, etc is done HERE. This is where I get the support and testing. I've asked Blackcoin to help test and nobody has done so and has been apathetic to the idea... perhaps they are exhausted from the price drop or the lack of branding. There are a few loyal members left and then there is Gritt and Janko who are still very active and doing colored coins implementations and other things. Regardless, we have an extremely strong brand and one of the best tight knit communities I've been a part of. You might think my answer is indirect. Yes up until this point they have gotten all of our improvements and that is because rat4 added the custom staking command that is completely essential for BitBay. Without those simple API commands, I would not be able to vote, cold stake, or spend from any p2sh or multisig and this includes frozen coins. So I am completely obligated to at least give them staking. Beyond that though. I was just involved in a discussion with Sirlose/Munti and he raised a very good point. The community has been a gem for me, some of the core community have sort of been guardian angels. The amount of hours Sirlose and Craig put into this weekly is a lot. Without it, I wouldn't have gotten this far. So we will discuss which features to release from this point forward for BlackHalo and when. I can assure you BitBay gets the Lion-share, the community is overpowered and does a ton of work and BitBay as a brand is more conducive to markets. BitBay as in E-Bay brands better for markets on its own virtue and it has been used a lot. Almost nobody uses BitHalos markets. So I don't even check them and consider I have almost completely stopped marketing BitHalo altogether my most recent PR moves have all been BitBay exclusively (with only brief mention of BitHalo when the reverse used to be true). The major different up until this point has been decentralized pegging. This feature is not to be underestimated. It's my ace in the hole. It is a feature I consider potentially just as powerful than double deposit. It changes the entire crypto industry when you have a currency that can protect its own value and roll in any direction without using centralized forces or trading tricks. It even opens the doors to decentralized backing. I can't implement that into BLK because I don't control their github and they don't seem to have an interest in it anyways. As for the templates, I personally think there is no reason not to release them as otherwise the software is only limited to custom templates. But then again, they don't use the markets, most of the community didn't bother to help test them etc. So Sirlose and I will meet with some of the other core to discuss what BlackHalo gets (and when more crucially) from this point moving forward. And how to release features in BitHalo that are cross platform. It's funny Blackcoin wasn't my coin to begin with, I was just a community member so everything they got was for free. So it is possible to do a delayed release for certain BlackHalo features or not release newly developed features such as anti-keylogger and other bonus features that are not being supported by the community itself. Decentralized pegging opens the doors for bonds, credit swaps, decentralized backing, different types of liquidity sub-premium and premium classes of money and just redefines crypto assets in general. We will discuss it and let you know how things beyond pegging apply. But I can assure you. Pegging is extremely powerful. You can't have decentralized markets without price stability. We can't even survive as a currency if we can't grow in price and we don't want to manipulate price so we need technology to eliminate the market maker!! To be honest, it blows my mind that there isn't millions flowing through BitBay as we speak. But there is some sense in future templates and features going here so let me discuss that with core and get back to you with how we handle releases now that the promise of Cold Staking was honored. NightTrader is a different subject completely and since I've had to abandon the microtrading protocol the only other way is atomic trade but again i run into the problem of it being a cross platform solution. Thats why the design of that is on hold."

I mean I see lot of negative stuff in their threads and they have not even paid for it anyway. You essentially gave it to them for free.  I found it negative in their thread and sold over 500k of blackcoin way back. Glad I did. Too much arguing and infighting. They even scould rat4 calling him a drunk and he is probably one of the best POS coders out there. It's a very parasitic community. Rat4 should dump them all and start a new project. I'm behind bay 100% since it is amazing to see a project have such a terrible start and still push forward against all the odds. Even now I suspect some of these people are still dumping and crushing the price down. I wish we would have forked it and nulled their wallets from the start they have crushed this down for years. This deserves to be a top 3 coin imho. Volume is still good though almost always in the top 10 vol at bittrex. When the qt is gone and the market place is acting as the main wallet I think people will start to realise what they have.  Adoption will be everything. I think it will be a snowball effect once people start using the markets."

It is true that there were a lot of people in the community who said things they probably shouldn't have, there is still a lot of loyal Blackcoin holders. So I simply have to structure how we do releases, what features get released and so forth. Our focus is on markets, they never branded for markets. BitHalo was however branded for contracts. The subject is not entirely transparent. So like I said we will discuss future non-pegging features in core. Obviously they get bug fixes. NightTrader is on hold until I solve its protocol issue... hopefully after BitBays pegging completes this will boom and I won't have to be struggling as much for finances and I can re-investigate decentralized exchange. Most likely it would not be the original microtrading. In the meantime, I've got to focus on coding and the community will have to help bring new people to test and use the markets etc."

Since votes require to be confirmed through stake reward: A) it obliterates spam as they will also have to pay a .00005554 fee and painstakingly wait for confirmations via stake rewards B) it keeps whales from 'pwning' a decision since they have to compete for staked blocks to confirm their transaction! So if 1 whale votes yes for a topic at hand and 100 small fish vote no, you'd essentially have 100 computers attempting to process a stake reward (with vote attached) compared to 1 computer owned by the whale trying to vote the opposite!

        "Exactly, I mean when bay is actually fully complete there are only probably a handful of cryto's that have any purpose left. I think it is very important to try to keep our thread on page 1 of the ANN section. Lots of noobs and others that have not previously taken a serious look at bay will start to do so if we are always on page 1.  Although this is an aged project compared to most you are still getting in on this on the ground floor. This is hardly above ICO price and yet it now has achieved what was only talked about back then. I don't think many people realise that just because it has been out a few years the opportunity to be in on ground level still exists.. I think a new thread title that captures more attention could be useful. Perhaps even a new thread. We leave the past behind in this old thread full of spam and old negative memories. A fresh start. BITBAY -   - - We're just getting   here... come see for YOURSELF NOW!! -- get someone who knows how to insert attention catching graphics into the title without it looking cheap and cheesy. OP is just too big with to many graphics and info. We want them in the thread trying out the wallet with videos to guide them straight away. I think we should have links to the videos and only the marketplace wallet now.  I mean it is simply the new wallet with all the features packed inside it is so different from the normal QT's it is simply mindblowing for most people. A faucet in the market place giving a some BAY to those that complete a basic smart contract. That smart contract can be mentioning BAY in another thread pointing out it's great new wallet and amazing features without spamming. Or even wearing a BAY avatar /sig for 1 week or more. Once people are in and using the new wallet to complete a simple contract to get their free bay then I expect they MUST be convinced this stupid 1M MC is ludicrous in the face of other total shit coins having magnitudes higher MC. I think a fresh new thread with immediate simple guide to downloading the new marketplace wallet and completing a smart contract for coins is the secret to getting anyone to see just how different and advanced bitbay is. We then make those contracts we set up for free coins beneficial to bay by driving more people directly to the thread via posts, avatar and sig campaigns ...the thread does the rest to start a nice cycle going. The only issue is the source of the bay for the contracts. I would suggest all whales here donate all of their pos coins at least if not a nice chunk of bay to get it all rolling."

Let's see what others say on the matter. But yeah back to the voting... The beauty of it is that it can either be public or private based on the users desire. You are allowed to enter a 20 character string of your choice for your custom vote. It can be as simple as posting 2 votes to gather consensus on pretty much anything. If you want to know what others' opinion's\u00a0 are on the gold market, you could create 2 votes like: GoldBull and GoldBear Those strings turn into an individual burn address that tally up all the deposits from staked votes. So imagine this setup for a potential decentralized trustless money management think tank. It would consist of a group of verified respectable traders and managers. You could essentially ask their group (for a fee I'm sure) investment advice like the one above. They would then vote on the matter. And you could verify their vote because you not only can count the votes in the client, but you can utilize the blockchain to verify the addresses that sent the vote to the burn address! Any sort of unverified address would be disregarded. Or better yet, the advisers track record would create a sort of 'network weight' similar to staking with more coins. So we could even add a twist to their fee for their services. Rather than just pay them a flat rate fee they distribute amongst themselves, you could send the fee to a custom python contract that retains the coins until after the vote deadline and the correct voters are determined. Then the coins locked would be divvied up proportionally to the voters who provided the correct answer! The losers don't deserve a reward, and this forces them to try harder next time! Heck this is just a start! The possibilities are mind blowing. I know language strings are limited because, well... there are only so many ways to ask \"BuyBTC\" or \"SellBTC\" but that doesn't apply to random strings So a random string could apply a massive amount of anonymity and give a near infinite number of strings to create a vote for. For example: 'kJSisigusSwosid' could be applied to the example above (a money management think tank), and that community would be notified publically or privately that that string represents a decrypted vote for \"I've got 5000 shares of IBM, should I hold or sell?\" Pretty amazing power at our fingertips! All without the need for a middleman to take a cut! Imagine a money manager that works for 'xyz' bank during the day, and by night, a freelance investment adviser without his boss taking a cut for his services!"

Price does attract volume but if we go to $1 too fast then we might throttle the supply too much and thus our volume might not be organic. So we need to slowly build to that target. Regardless, our community will choose targets and move towards them. With the rolling peg we can force any price.

The first feature on the list is Cold Staking.\u00a0 This is a security feature making it nearly impossible for people to break into your wallet and manipulate your BAY balance in any way.\u00a0 If you are familiar with BitBay, you know there are two keys for every wallet.\u00a0 Cold Staking gives you the option to put those two keys on separate systems.\u00a0 This means not only would a potential hacker need to break into the computer BitBay is running on and crack your first key (which is all the protection most wallets offer), but they would also need to find and break into the second computer and unencrypt a second key as well. This feature is currently working for computers on the same LAN (Local Area Network), and research is being done now into how to make it possible to connect the two systems over the internet.\u00a0 Working out the details for this has been a challenge due to firewalls and dynamic IP addresses, but once it is completed in a future release, we will provide you with the information you need to make it work for you.  Cold Staking, along with other features you will read about in the upcoming days, helps make BitBay the most complete and secure digital currency software available.\u00a0 This is the second update released in 2017, and more monumental updates, such as the rolling peg you have been hearing about, are on the way.\u00a0 Hang on tight BitBay fans."

And their premises were a tad hypocritical the entire PDF was a rant. Varying opinions of the subject were balanced. And still they complain of overseas exchanges but forget that many corporations they support are not registered in the states. Also they are questionably subject to more manipulation because nothing they do is transparent and favors sharks. Many companies hold more than 51% premium stock. Then of course they claim to want to protect consumers but forget about Enron, Bernie Madoff and Facebooks obviously manipulated nonsense IPO. Who needs them? And I've also heard that it would be too much trading of paper as opposed to moving a real commodity so it can harm the price temporarily. The thing I thought was bullish was the arbitrage (which the SEC complained about ironically) and the injection of billions of dollars to the market of fresh money. But perhaps those investors will get frustrated with the old way of doing things and simply buy BTC directly. Or better yet, ALTCOINS! To be honest I was almost certain they would accept it due to political positioning. But perhaps that was an oversight as the powers that be might have other plans bank related or delayed timing."

        "Though Client Staking does not have to do with security or privacy like most of the other updates in v1.26, I personally appreciate the convenience Client Staking offers BitBay users. If you are familiar with BitBay, you know it is a Proof of Stake 3.0 (PoS 3.0) digital currency, and you can earn BAY simply by leaving your Wallet open for staking with your coins in it. The Smart Client Marketplace is a separate piece of software, and if you wanted to monitor the market while staking, both the Wallet and Client had to be installed and open at the same time. With this update you no longer need to have both the Wallet and Client running together. The marketplace has PoS 3.0 integrated, and whether you are using the Client to create contracts or browse for your next purchase, your BAY coins are working for you in the background and earning interest. All you have to do is unlock your wallet for staking. This might lead you to ask the question, \u0093Why do I need the wallet then?\u0094 The obvious answer is, you don\u0092t. The only thing it was still required for was staking. The BitBay Wallet will still continue to work as it does today, but won\u0092t be a major part of BitBay\u0092s future. I would recommend transferring your BAY from your wallet to the more secure client when you get a chance. I do not know of any other cryptocurrency project out there where the staking wallet is built directly into a fully functional decentralized platform. Add this kind of convenience to the unprecedented account security measures being added, and you can see there is a lot of hard work going into BitBay on a continual basis to deliver a finished product people can use and trust. What enhancements with real-world use have you seen delivered lately from the other digital currencies? [BitBay Slack -  [BitBay Marketplace Site -  [BitBay Bitcointalk Thread -"

Heck... just look at your signature advertising ^^^ BitBay will be perfect for creating peer to peer trustless gaming contracts similar to your V-Dice Dapp. And there is no need to dilute your investment capital in \"tokens\" required to use any sort of Dapp (in general). With BitBay you will be able to use BitBay to transact with the python contract game or app. That way you won't have to 'ethertize' your investment capital through exchange slippage and spread losses, just so you can try out a new Dapp by first buying their tokens. I'm sure if a creator of a python custom programmed peer to peer contract might want to earn some money for his coding, he could add it into the program as a BitBay service fee - or not. But the point is these custom python contracts won't create reason to spawn countless, various tokens in the process, keeping a strong focal point for demand in BitBay and nothing else."

Also if there is only 1 (great) developer and no marketing budget how will word spread? \u00a0Marketing is clearly an issue at the moment. Also how long before the other smart contract options are available, like \"find a job\" or \"hire someone\"? They look useful.  Thanks."

        "Okay so there is so much to mention here... First off the reason why it's not Darknet is because I'm not anonymous and I'm trying to reach a wider audience. With that said, this is probably the perfect \"Darknet\" market... its what Shadowcash is attempting and we've been done with it over a year with much more features especially hard core security ones to boot. Their markets don't even exist yet and they got the idea of double deposit from Halo. I even remember when VeritasBS tried to reverse engineer my code because I refused to work on his coin. There was a funny dispute on reddit about that years ago. The only thing BitBay doesn't have is anonymous transactions like Monero. Bitmessage is completely anonymous though and I've discussed with a security expert and he thinks Bitmessage might be more anonymous than Tor (due to control of exit nodes attack on Tor).  The power of double deposit escrow and pegging are a million times more powerful than some small dark market in the corner of the internet. This is tech that can truly change the world for the better. I've fallen in love with double deposit ever since I had the idea 4 years ago. The news already did an article on my markets and I think this article explains it best: I'm a freedom lover and want to free people. But this means freeing people who don't realize they need to be freed. Average everyday consumers, the ones whose souls need it the most. Double deposit escrow is the PERFECT tool to eliminate deception from society. 2 party trustless double deposit escrow is why I've worked 4 years straight in Bitcoin as a dev on Halo. So I will then ask you, don't you see the value in the unbreakable contracts? You claim that Ebay and Amazon are so much better, but have you considered the sellers can send you an empty box and complain and reverse paypal payments? And what about Freelancer and Elance? Are you aware they can lie about their credentials and pad their hours and do poor work? And what about the fees middle men collect? And there is tons of other kinds of contracts. Everything in society is based on agreement. We have solved agreement which is a major piece of the puzzle. And the rolling peg is the beginning of the solution to the economy aspect (supply/demand). Sure you can find more items on Ebay and Amazon but we have already discussed reselling E-bay items on the Bitbay markets by forwarding shipping. Middle men must be eliminated from society once and for all it is a bad foundation for any contract. The only people who should be judge, jury and executioner of a contract are the two parties themselves. Any addition of a third party destroys the truth and freedom of the deal. If the root of the tree is bad, the leaves perish. We are planting a NEW TREE. This tree is designed to be healthy and bear fruit. Do you really think this coin won't be huge in the future? Look at what it does. Deception is not possible in BitBay. The deposits are placed by both sides so they MUST be honest or lose their deposits! How can I limit this important concept to a small subsection of the internet? Just so you know, we have the moderation key but Bitmessage is practically a decentralized internet... so we can't know about every market that exists there. We moderate the ones we know about. I'm aware I'm not liable for the \"internet\" and cannot possibly prevent how people use the software nor do I want to nor am I legally obligated to(I'm just an open source dev). But still we are looking to reach a much bigger audience. I've done a big initiative to market recently and it was a big distraction from work. We have published tons of articles over the past month including a paid PR campaign. But that means I'm editing interviews, articles and managing community and it is as you say impossible to do that and code. Happily, the slack and bitcoin talk group is probably one of the best and tight knit in all of crypto. These guys are there to test and constantly give enthusiasm to the project. As for the synchronization that can eventually be solved by having the client look up the balance on chainz. But for now it downloads the blockchain. With that said BitHalo does not download the chain and uses the method i just described. The Cash for Coins templates work. The rest of the templates are coming very soon. For now you can still hire people using the custom template. As for orders there was always about 10 or so on the markets you have to wait for the markets to sync it can take hours. Also i think most of the orders are pulled waiting for the updated build on the 22nd. And I don't think you were being negative, those are very cutting edge questions that need to be asked."

        "I discussed this with Meta recently. A mobile version of Halo would require a rewrite of Halo completely and thus millions of dollars. I would probably have to at least project manage that or spec out a lot of the ideas and give the sections of source code needed and the solutions to the non-trivial problems of a cellphone app. With that said, someone can find an investor who wants to buy rights to a mobile app... they just need to realize I'm not going to be in a golden cage. I can help show them what needs to be done and can negotiate how they can make a good return off the app purchases and other things but it will be up to them to push it or we would need to find a manager who is willing to throw a few years of his life into it. And I think the money needed for that would be in the multi-millions. It could net a tremendous amount of profit though... so it's always something to keep in the back of our minds. Meta was under the opinion that it would be the catalyst to take BitBay to the top 5."

        "Yes it has been discussed. There are several resons we don't allow darknet items. The most important one is that neither David nor the team is willing to be involved in illegal activities in any way. Another reason is that the legal market is so much bigger than the illegal one, that it doesn't make sense to focus on darknet. Some vanilla items might be ok per se, but having them listed in the same market that sells anything from electronics to baby cloths is not. It is however possible to use private markets for that. There have been several posts relevant to this question starting here:  We don't have a big marketing budget, but we do have some money for it. More importantly, we have some very skilled people on the team that work for free or symbolic pay. Lately we have also seen several community members helping out.  2017 is the first year we have started marketing, and we have already done a bit.  -We had a big buzzword campaign. -Twitter and facebook are active again. -Blog on   has new articles all the time. -Several articles written for/by other outlets (4 or 5 this far in 2017 I think. Last two are mentioned on previous page in this thread) -Radio interview with David More is in the pipeline... You can actually do that already with custom contracts. But I assume you are talking about the templates that will make it a lot more user friendly. We never give ETA's, but now that important improvements and features are mostly done, David will focus on the templates. \u00a0 Because most of those that have been active in posting contracts are now busy testing the new release. Also David recently posted this in our slack: \"Please everyone who does a lot of contracts... do me a favor and in the email you use for contracts please do the following: Then please go into the email you use for contracts and delete all emails that have the subject line as \"Halo\" So everything should be clear unless you are negotiations in a contract then finish it and do this step The reason is because I'm trying to increase performance of emails and for old unencrypted emails the inbox will simply bloat\" The marketplace will fill up again once the new release is out. But there is only so much the team can do. The community has to help get this going by posting contracts, so lets hope many in here will do that."

        "If you are unfamiliar with keyloggers, this form of spyware is one way hackers use to discover your passwords. By hiding a small program deep inside your system\u0092s folders, a keylogger records each letter or number pressed on your keyboard. The keyloggers store this information in files to be retrieved later by the person who placed it there. The BitBay Anti-Keylogger brings up an onscreen keyboard and a timer lasting approximately one second. When you hover over a letter with your mouse pointer the timer starts. If you move to another letter the timer starts over. If you stay on the letter you want entered, the timer completes and the letter is entered into the passphrase field. Users will want to be sure to remember to use the Shift key first for capital letters. As you can imagine, while this feature eliminates concerns you may have about keyloggers stealing your private information, it also slows down how quickly you can enter your passwords. This issue is less of a concern when you realize you are still able to type in the passphrase field as well. This means if you have a long code consisting of many words like I do, you can type in the majority of it using the keyboard, and use the Anti-Keylogger to obscure just some of the letters. If this is your long term vault for the majority of your BAY, you may want to only use the Anti-Keylogger, but if it is the account you use regularly to access the BitBay Marketplace you might choose to use it for just a portion of your passphrase. The choice of how much you use this new feature is yours. In a world where even our own governments are caught attempting to monitor everything we do online, the Anti-Keylogger is just one more way BitBay is looking out for your security. I don\u0092t know of any other cryptocurrency out there with as many built in features to assure your coins are never stolen.

        "In the crypto community we are all familiar with the Bitcoin fiasco over blockchain sizing. \u00a0This issue seems so simple to fix, yet the complexity to execute is almost comical. It demonstrates Bitcoin has become a truly centralized governance hodgepodge consisting of centralized miners and self-appointed developers. This has led to talks of forking Bitcoin into 2 separate entities. \u00a0 BitBay\u0092s Decentralized Voting update helps to eliminate these issues Bitcoin is facing. With BitBay, gridlock will no longer be an issue for future innovations and development. The core build developer, David Zimbeck, has integrated a decentralized voting UI built into the Client. This voting protocol will serve multiple purposes.  The main purpose is for it to work alongside the decentralized algorithm to regulate the rolling peg technology (due to be complete by the end of the year). \u00a0This method will grant miners the ability to cast their vote for either increasing or shrinking the current amount of liquid BAY coins available. Miners will be given 3 options; to manually vote for increase, manually vote for decrease, or let the algorithm decide for them.  Unlike other coins with decentralized voting features, this UI is extremely user friendly \u0096 no coding skills are required. Each vote costs almost nothing to cast, at 0.00005554 BAY. \u00a0Requiring a fee and using staking to inject votes on the blockchain helps regulate and protect the vote from spam and minimizes short term manipulation. \u00a0The system will then gradually inject those votes onto the blockchain as your wallet remains open and staking (or cold staking). \u00a0This creates a \u0091fair\u0092 playing field for the entire community. \u00a0For example, imagine a vote that has the community split between the majority of the small and medium coin holders against a minority of large coin holders. \u00a0Since the majority acts as one voice and has stronger processing powers to stake for each block, they could essentially outweigh the minority \u0091whales\u0092, and win majority consensus! The voting system provides custom capabilities as well. \u00a0Voting in the Client can be started by anyone by entering a 20-character string into the UI, and then specifying how many votes they wish to cast for that item. \u00a0The 20-character string allows for nearly unlimited voting possibilities. \u00a0The UI even provides you with a tool to count the votes through the Client. These votes can be private or as public as you wish to broadcast them. \u00a0The string entered into the UI field simply converts to a blockchain address (burned) that anyone can track on the blockchain. \u00a0This creates the opportunity for anyone to track other Client accounts also participating in the vote. \u00a0This will open up the ability to create decentralized prediction markets similar to AUGUR! \u00a0Imagine in the future where you can ask for proven market analysts to vote on your market request! \u00a0This has the ability to turn into decentralized money management without the advisors even holding your investment capital! The possibilities with this decentralized voting UI will add yet another amazing milestone for the most advanced cryptocurrency wallet on the planet\u0085 and this is just the beginning! Adaptability is key to remaining ahead of the competition and now that we have a voice to vote for virtually anything, new innovations to BitBay will never be stifled and bogged down by gridlock and politics. \u00a0 To take a look at other features being released on March 22nd as part of the v1.26 update, check"

Simple, secure and they know best because they buy the hardware and process transactions so they know the throughput and can absolutely adjust to it. Besides, Bitcoin is so centralized they are some of the only ones who even bother to download the chain. Of course we already have that now. We can vote on whatever we want. But that doesn't directly effect block size or anything but at least the community can vote to increase it and we can fork. A recent discussion on slack was weather or not we should do a vote to increase the stake because the reward is less than 1% by mistake.

        "Yeah Lightning has had that problem. Their design was very similar to a multisignature exchange i wanted to make. Until i realized the collusion attacks. Lightning will not suffer from collusion as long as the money is in the accounts. Here is a sketch of why this matters. Joe has more money than Alice and they are in a 2 of 2 So if Jane also has an account of 2 of 2 with Joe, she can promise Joe money and use HTLC to connect the two channels Joe will promise money to Alice and it all works!! This idea is perfectly sound no money has to touch the blockchain. So you ask, why can't Jane promise money to Alice? After all they can use Pune Dryja channels to link the 2 of 2 multisig accounts. Sure but then, what if Joe was also Jane?! He can trick Alice and withdraw the money owed from his own 2 of 2. Because Joe didn't promise funds directly to Alice, she loses everything she was owed! And this is what will ALWAYS happen when Joe has LESS money than Alice. She will be owed money that isn't in the 2 of 2 account. And there my friends lies the rub. This creates the same arbitration risk that we have seen in 2 of 3 accounts. It only works when the money is in both sides of the deal. Therefore, the only way to do lighting is for Joe to be really, really rich. And that is centralized and makes the rich richer. But it also runs another serious concern. What if Joe gets hacked? What if Joe keeps reusing the same public keys and cryptoanalysis is used to reverse them? Granted this attack isn't proven but he can still get hacked. So even if real money is owed there is a hacking concern. What will really happen in lightning?! It will be a debt settlement network. Where people irresponsibly route payments that could be defaulted on at any time. Therefore it will not be decentralized and run risk of fraud and hacking. People will learn to \"trust\" the middle man again and the same bullshit starts all over again just like the USD. Whats the best solution? Don't do lighting as your primary payment routing method. Perhaps use lots of servers to chop up the traffic or something. Facebook after all stores insane amounts of data so how is that different from a really large blockchain run by thousands of nodes sharing the data? Use BitBays frozen funds! This is a very futuristic concept but in theory if we were pegged and lots of people had frozen funds it would be easier to route debt since so many users would have the frozen funds as collateral. Surely they wouldn't be as valuable as the liquid funds but they count for something. At the sign of hacking nobody would sell them frozen funds anymore and thus they would have a hard time building up creditworthiness (similar to using it for DDE). So those are some of the best concepts so far dealing with bloat. The Bitcoin github is being subverted by some extremely selfish people who think they are Bitcoin. Its no surprise they ignored my request. They don't care about decentralization. Bitcoin core and Ethereum are some of the most pro-middleman pro-government groups I've seen. They remind me of bankers. Years ago I said \"Decentralizing the money will not change the world, decentralize the media and then the world will be saved\". This I still believe to be a cogent statement even if its unrealistic. With that said, I guess they(Bitcoin core devs) forgot that all one needs to do is copy+paste and change the port number to get off their network. And with decentralized pegging those small economies might even be healthy. Too bad they are watching this play out before their very eyes. And altcoins are finally booming."

        "Over the last couple weeks we have focused on multiple ways BitBay update to v1.26 will provide increased security, including the Anti-Keylogger and Cold Staking. Here we want to tell you how BitBay will also protect your privacy by including Tor to conceal your location when using BitBay. For the Client to function with all of its many features, it must request data from various URLs. For example, \u0095 For Price Tracking to exist on the \u0093Buy/Sell Coins\u0094 template, the Client must request updates from coinmarketcap.com. \u0095 Once completed, the \u0093Buy/Sell Anything\u0094 template will include both price tracking and a shipping calculator, which both require queries to shipping APIs. \u0095 The Client regularly checks for version updates. \u0095 The Client confirms timestamps and other minor data online. This built-in TOR feature will allow you remain anonymous from these \u0091under the hood\u0092 requests. This feature is quite easy to set up. After you have installed and synced the Client: \u0095 First make sure Tor is running \u0095 Then go to Settings tab -> General Settings \u0095 And in the \u0091Proxy TOR\u0092 field, type: 127.0.0.1:9150 \u0095 Then close the general settings window Congratulations! Your Client is now masking your IP address for any Client related Internet requests! Just one more feature of many in which BitBay places your privacy and peace of mind above the rest of the competition."

It definitely helped motivate me to work hard on this. Also to some of the other nice things being said here. Thanks. So anyways everyone the new build is now up on the server. We will start posting more orders on the markets. The next update will contain updates to support exotic spending in the UI such as checklocktimeverify which is needed to reflect frozen coins in the UI. This also will show us \"parked coins\", \"dead mans switch\", \"account conversion\", burn and just a general better UI for the advanced sending menu. Currently that menu is where you will find our pay to email feature that lets you send payments using steganography. Remember to always backup and password protect your keys and if you hide the keys in photos make sure you have a hard copy backup. You can contract via Bitmessage or encrypted email. However we only support a few providers that are listed in the client. So just as easy is Bitmessage which is decentralized serverless email. The setup wizard explains a lot of that and there is tutorials on our youtube channel. To better understand how the smart contracts work and how to use the decentralized markets the guys on slack are always more than happy to help and test. Cheers! ~David"

If I or anyone in core don't know the name of the market we can't possibly moderate it because it would be secret to us. However if we discover a market that would be worth banning we can. Also we can give out the moderation key to people who insist. Now the way users see this key is, they subscribe to that key. When they see the moderator send messages to them like \"ban this user\" or \"ban this market\" they do so. Users themselves can FLAG orders. So there is also a decentralized moderation layer. If John starts a market that sells shoes and people start posting job offers or advertisements that have nothing to do with the market his users can flag the order. After about 5 flags or so an order is removed. There is also a second moderation key. One for supermod and one for regular mod. A supermod can shut down markets and perform public key bans. A regular mod can remove orders. Hopefully that explains it. And it certainly is decentralized, those are simply basic systems. We can't moderate what we don't see. And ultimately we are not responsible for contents of the markets. I'm just a dev and we don't tell people how to use the software. No more than we can moderate google search results."

Anyway put in a couple of thousand $$ into this coin, unfortunately paid more than i needed to as it's since dropped a bit. I'm sure it will go back up soon, but if not consider it a donation to the cause.  I'm telling everyone i know about this coin (and some of them have already invested) as it has a bright future if managed well and the buy in window is getting ever shorter.

We don't need hype we just need organised marketing and showing people the wallet. I personally believe we need the popular features too to become popular. You can not fight what people think they want even if it is not needed. Slap some masternodes into bay and some good privacy and you would have probably seen some top 10 action with pivX. I don't really like masternodes but they do encourage loyalty and incentive to hold the coin more than a very small pos rate. Anyway we are still at the start with bitbay we can grow and grow in an organic way. We got some attention in the last few days. This is probably a lot of the 2x 'ers cashing out anyway hopefully swapping into stronger hands for the real rise later. We are still up over 100% from a few weeks back so that's a good jump. Even a floor of 250 would be reasonable even if stupidly under value again. We can rise from there.  If you want the coins at 10000 sats then you need to believe it is worth 10000 sats or greater and not bail out just to get 2x gains. Compare it to other project in the top 20. It deserves to be there at least. If it had good privacy and mobile then top 5 to me anyway."

Some of the things you suggested are already in the pipeline or, at the very least, being considered. I think we all feel that it is better to release new features at a reasonable, sustainable pace rather than dump lots of changes in a short time period. There are so many ways to enhance Bitbay that we must be careful about drowning it in features and loosing the original purpose. Anyway, very nice to have you here and good luck in Bay and ARK!"

I like some of the pos masternode coins, or just double pos for those that accumulate and hold say 0.5\u00a0 1 million or 3 million or 10 million bay and hold it for a long time with no spends. Different rates for different amounts and time held. anyway we're still up and doing better than a few weeks back thats very good progress still."

        "Right now I'm the only one developing so thats it. As for my information (is it not on the site?) I'm one of the least anonymous people there is in Bitcoin. You can find my background all over the internet in chess, acting, commercial production, photography, oil rigs, real estate, landsmen/easements, and satellite installation. There isn't some big team of people I control 100% of the code. However there is people who help out on slack and are pretty much there daily, and the guy who made the new website and got paid to do so. I'm not sure if there would be a reason to list them or not. Its up to them I suppose. I mean there is no reason to make the team appear bigger than it actually is. At the same time the slack guys are testing every day and I'm not trying to take away from that at all. Sirlose has had some long discussions with me about the economics of pegging we realize that it will be the first time anyone has tried it. All the \"big successful\" ICOs you are referring to have that but are lying just to get investors money. The teams they do have they abandon. If it wasn't for the fact that I told everyone what Bob/BTER/Dai/Gekko were doing we would also have the \"illusion\" of a big team. While they sit there and laugh while I'm doing all the coding. So yeah I wish to manifest what you are looking for but I'm an honest person and cannot embellish. Heck if I could find people to code with me it would be great but I'm not sure such a coder exists who would put all his time into this. Especially without funding. We did some PR with Bitcoinbuzz and it was okay and had a few articles written around the same time as well as doing a banner on coinmarketcap. But i end up having to manage all of those campaigns and there isn't a guy to do marketing. So I'm either a marketer or a coder. Not sure what the community wants me to be. I can assure you one thing. If I'm the marketer this will take forever to get finished. So better that I'm just the coder and forget about marketing. I didn't know that PR.com was only 500. Is this true? If so cheaper than Bitcoinbuzz. But thanks for the advice man. The software works, there isn't anything else in Bitcoin that even comes close to it. And judging from all the hype I would say we won't see anything like it for a few more years at least."

I talked about some on Reddit, but the overview is that in order to get people to start using it there needs to be a small target market.\u00a0 For that market, BitBay trades need to be as easy as the current trades, but offer something more.\u00a0 I know several markets that operate exclusively on bitcoin/western union sales.\u00a0 The problem is there is no protection for the buyer, and it's very easy for the sellers to scam.\u00a0 We can pitch BitBay to these markets as an option for safe bitcoin sales for buyers.\u00a0 Little do they know that they're actually stimulating the Bay economy and growing the popularity.\u00a0 Soon, they'll bring it to other markets, and it'll grow further.\u00a0  Things that will aid in the adoption of BitBay by these markets: 1. Making it as easy to use BitBay from Bitcoin as possible.\u00a0 The fewer steps needed, the more likely people are to use it. 2. Convincing buyers about how this works.\u00a0 Some simple graphics that can be used to explain why BitBay is better than Bitcoin in a pitch to the target market will be super helpful. 3. Possibly having a 'BitBay Lite' download that would be impossible to mess up for the target market.\u00a0 Like no unnecessary features, and so intuitive that an 8th grader could use it with ease.\u00a0 This would be exclusively for contracts where one person is paying with coins and one person sends a good outside of the BitBay client. 4. Having the 'BitBay Lite' have preset values that favor the buyer compared to the current system.\u00a0 I can get into the details if you want, but people would like it most if the buyer's reserve was ~0.5x the contract value, and the seller's reserve was ~1.5x the contract value. This is just an idea to get people to start using it on a pretty small scale.\u00a0 It would be very minimal, very targeted marketing.\u00a0 However, I can guarantee it is SIGNIFICANTLY more effective than more generalized marketing, long term.\u00a0 This concept is a home-run and a half, but if grassroots groups don't start using it you can be sure it won't gain any widespread traction.\u00a0 The same thing happened with Bitcoin.\u00a0 It took very small circles using it for it to gain any popularity.\u00a0  Let me know what you think."

BitBay has the rolling decentralized peg which creates different speeds of liquid funds. It will be done later this year. We feel like this will redefine money.

The ways in which unbreakable contracts revolutionizes law and not to mention international business is one that not even Ethereum can do better.

Without it, this project wouldn't have existed. There was a bunch of articles on myself and on Halo and as \u00a0bentach has pointed out, those articles aren't on the OP.

Most critically the markets are peer to peer on Bitmessage and it uses double deposit escrow. DRPD, I'm the dev. I'm originally the coder of BitHalo and now BitBay. My name was known outside of crypto, was in films, produced commercials in Los Angeles, worked on oil rigs, did real estate work, and am a world renowned chess puzzlemarker known for breaking records and tasks  I've been in this space for 3 years and never switched projects. Was hired on BitBay and the founders left after they abused my rep. So I took over the coding since I was hired to do it anyway and have been coding for 2 years. You don't need to invest. Just download the software there is a Faucet that will teach you to use the markets. We aren't forcing anyone to invest. I'm simply trying to finish my roadmap. We noticed that my name wasn't on the OP. There is no team of coders and marketers. I'm the only one. The slack group with guys such as Craig, Munti, Meta, Rqdxrocket, funsponge, gitgud, cryptohunter, catnip, lowercase, gjsteele71, jbar and many others have helped with testing and promoting.  For the ones who want to be on an \"official\" team I'm assuming Craig, Munti and Meta(he did the website) might consider it. But in all honesty I'm the only coder and apparently this code does more than pretty much anything else on the market. I'm known for making the worlds first smart contracts, worlds first decentralized markets and first multisig, multicoin and joint account software 3+ years ago. Again from my comment above bentach has brought to my attention that my name is not on the OP. I'm one of the least anonymous people in crypto and one of the easiest people to find. AMA"

Preferably into a web version also. At the current rate, I've calculated that its faster for me to do everything myself. If I somehow magically get millions of dollars then I would certainly consider taking on coders also because the investors would have a guarantee if something happens to me. There was an ICO, I wasn't in control of the finances, a lot of lies were told to me. There was 4 founders, Steven Dai, BTER, Bobsurplus and Gekko. I was just the dev but they cut me in as a partner. I told them they had to supply me with devs to make it successful. Instead, they all vanished after the fundraiser and didn't do a single minute of work. (other than trying to bully everyone for more funds). Then they tried to trash my name. So you know, I just took over the project with the small amounts of Bitcoin I did make and have been living off that for two years. Things are a bit tight, but i manage. I'm a very stubborn bastard and really refuse to see investors lose. I'm happy to see the price is now ABOVE the ICO. If I had left like the others, it would have been in the dust. The rolling peg might be of particular interest to you. And bentach, I'm going to discuss with core the best way to update the OP. You are right we should also have our news articles on there.

Also, David, here's one constructive comment about BitBay I received that might be helpful for you: \"I looked into BitBay & traded it for a few days. Seems like an interesting project & nice website, but the usability & complexity of the wallet is likely to prevent mass adoption. It might do well in smaller circles though, so I'm not ruling it out. Would like to see a more simplified user interface with a design that's more aesthetically pleasing . Project time frames also seem a bit bottle-necked. Developer, as talented as he may be, would be more productive if he would delegate workloads & not try to do it all himself (just my opinion obviously). Until then my focus for investments will be PIVX & ARK. I've got around the same amount of piv as you & I appreciate you highlighting the compounding interest of staking -awesome isn't it? lol :-) I love PIVX!  Also -check out Ark   when you get a chance. Relatively new project released last week -needless to say I grab quite a few. Ark has staking as well & price is still cheap. Great job on the videos Crypto Baron.  -PIV long & prosper -jazen\ufeff\" I personally grabbed some BitBay and I'm looking forward to its success."

        "I should specify that in the BitBay Lite, in order to initiate the contract, the buyer would have to pay immediately. \u00a0Otherwise, they would be able to initiate and void contracts for low costs that would cost the seller large amounts of money. [/quote] No I don't think you are understanding how these contracts work. They are unbreakable. Double deposit is simultaneous deposits by both sides and the payment for goods and services is advanced as well. So there is no way for either side to void a contract. Everything requires mutual consent or both parties lose funds [/quote] I understand how the contracts currently work, but I've been trying to market this platform to various communities that I know would use this platform. \u00a0The response has been that the current exact details of these contracts are not favorable in terms of people wanting to use BitBay. \u00a0The first users of this platform are 100% going to be people using BitBay as a safe alternative to Bitcoin. \u00a0There is somebody paying money, and somebody sending a good. \u00a0If I understand the current system, it requires buyers to front DOUBLE the price of the item. \u00a0If the seller doesn't come through, the buyer will lose twice as much money as the seller. \u00a0 -Both parties front the price of the item as the reserve: \u00a0Buyer Net Cost - $50 ......... Seller's Net Cost - $50. -Next, the buyer sends the seller the cost of the good: \u00a0 Buyer Net Cost - $100 ........

Seller's Net Cost - $0. I was suggesting an alternative contract system that would exist in addition to the current contract system. \u00a0In the additional option, you would have the buyer's reserve set at .5x the price + the advance of the cost of the good/service, and the seller's reserve set at 1.5x the price. \u00a0 -Both parties front the price of the item as the reserve: \u00a0Buyer Net Cost - $25 ......... Seller's Net Cost - $75. -Next, the buyer sends the seller the cost of the good: \u00a0 Buyer Net Cost - $75 .........

[/quote] If it crashed it may be due to antivirus maybe? I submitted a ticket with avast and they approved it already, download the newest version. I think AVG was also frustrating. The newer build might not trigger it because it doesn't elevate to admin within the script. Also, if it won't open check task manager, perhaps bitmhalo or bitbayd is running in the background... just force close it. If you want you can come on slack and i will walk you through it. You can negotiate those lower deposits. In every template you can set custom deposits. Its really up to the merchant and buyer. But the thing is new buyers having to put up the deposit equal to item value is pretty fair in my opinion. There is also guarantor contracts that make only one side deposit. It depends on a users reputation and KYC and level of trust really. A lite client wouldn't be easy to make. If you were a coder you would realize how tremendous amount of work UI/UX is especially for a single coder. A new skin isn't the only thing to consider it would in many cases require a refactor. It would be scope creep and distract me from the main roadmap. If i had millions then sure, a mobile wallet would be nice too or a \"lite\" mobile version of the client. Every contract is different, some are barter others are DDE... it depends on the deal."

        "BitBay\u0092s Decentralized Voting UI marks yet another amazing milestone for the most advanced cryptocurrency wallet on the planet. Today we announce the first Voting Poll to decide whether to fork to correct the BAY Staking reward as soon as possible or wait for the next scheduled fork. If you would like to participate in this historic event, you still have time to download and install the Client. All Clients must be 100% synchronized. In order to Stake/Vote you must be holding coins in the Client. Say goodbye to political centralized gridlock! This is the first official voting poll for the BitBay community. There will be many more to come as the coin continues to place itself above the competition as the most advanced cryptocurrency wallet in existence. As some may already know, when David upgraded the BitBay Staking protocol from POS 2.0 to POS 3.0, he made the innocent mistake of adjusting the coin\u0092s interest rate return to the incorrect amount. After this small glitch was found, David came to conclusion he would simply correct the Staking reward when BitBay is scheduled to fork for the implementation of the Rolling Peg technology, scheduled later this year. With the recent rise in price and substantial boost in community interest, more and more people are voicing their desire to fix this glitch now rather than wait. To be fair to all and remain true to a decentralized protocol, BitBay will host an official Voting Poll starting Saturday, 04/01/2017 at 7:00 AM UTC and ending on Tuesday, 04/04/2017 at 7:00 AM UTC. Only votes submitted on blocks in that timeframe will be counted. Anyone with coins can vote, as long as they have the Client installed and synchronized; the more coins you have stored on your Client the stronger your voting power becomes as all votes attach themselves to staked block rewards. Within the Client simply go to: Settings (tab) -> General Settings (dropdown menu) -> Mining/Staking and Voting (tab) In this window click on Add Vote button and enter: \u00a01.stakefork (for the stake reward to be adjusted as a priority) \u00a02.nostakefork (to wait until the rolling peg fork to adjust reward) Please note: use all lower case letters. Votes are case sensitive. The Client will then ask you how many times you wish to vote. All votes cost 0.000005554 BAY. Enter the desired amount of votes to cast and you are complete. Remember your Client must be staking in order to cast votes. Votes do not immediately tally into the system. Once you\u0092ve cast your total votes you wish to add, these votes will attach themselves to any future blocks you find while your Client stakes. You must keep you Client open and staking in order for it to continue to add votes to your choice. You will be able to count the votes applied to each option by clicking on the Count Vote option in that same window. Make a mental note of which block starts and ends in that timeframe of the vote to see the most accurate count, or you can use the blockchain explorer to track everyone\u0092s votes, as all votes are transferred to a burn address on the blockchain. Download the Client at   now and prepare to vote! If you are new to BitBay, please feel free to come join the community in BitBay's Slack -  !"

        "Not sure why you think that. You buy and support bay more you get more %. It's like a savings account. You hold it for longer you get more %. Everyone can buy in and hold at the same price. There was no unfair advantage for anyone to get easy coins. The % simply is not high enough to encourage saving. Tiny upswing everyone want to dump and try buy back later for less.  Masternodes although unfair if set up on coins gained through advantage are a great way to encourage loyalty and saving. You have this many coins in circ you need to encourage saving and holding until you have a large user base. Pivx is doing great because it encourages saving in chunks. You drop below 10000k coins you are dropping to a lower rate of income. MUE just realised the same thing in the last months and my 30 sats coins are   4200 sats lately."

        "I know masternodes are a fad in crypto at the moment. But that does not mean they make sense. Why go through the trouble of making a decentralized currency, market, etc and then start partially centralzing with masternodes? The functions of masternodes seems to me to mainly be a tool to jack up the price of coins that have no real world usage. That might work for a while, but the extra emission will counter that over time. So yea, there may be short term gains, but long term it's not such a good idea. BitBay does not go for short term solutions. We are in it for the long haul. Besides, you seem to forget that we have two things that will be much more effective than masternodes: 1.  Marked with double deposit escrow. It's still slow on the market atm, but it will pick up. And then you will see the effect of double deposit escrow on a coin. Consider this: When someone posts a contract to the market for \u00a0a $100 item, they also make a $100 worth of Bay deposit (if using recommended settings). What is the average time an \u00a0 item is posted before someone buys it? Some are sold imidiatly, and some are never sold. You pick your own numbers for this, but I'll suggest 10 days as an average now. That means that $100 item has locked up $100 worth of Bay for 10 days before it's even sold. Then you have the days it takes to ship the item. Again, pick your own numbers. domestic usually takes 2-5 days when I buy something on the internet, international 2-4 weeks. I'll pick 10 days as an average for this too. So that's another 10 days that sellers deposit is locked. Now add buyers $100 deposit from the moment the deal is made until he receives the item. That another $100 worth of bay locked for 10 days. + the $100 worth of Bay that he is paying for the item (if payment is in Bay) for 10 days. So a $100 deal locks up $100 worth of Bay for 20 days, + $200 worth of Bay for 10 days. If you sum it up and average it out on 1 day you get $4000 worth of Bay locked up for a $100 deal. That is a ratio of 1:40! Now imagine if we have an average daily turnover of $100k on our market (Sounds much atm, but nothing compared to ebay, craigs list etc). With an 1:40 ratio that would lock up 4 million dollars worth of Bay at any given moment on average. That is more than our entire marketcap atm! 2. We will have pegging. This will regulate the supply to meet the demand. And it is a much more precise tool than masternodes. To everyone in here: If you want to help increase value of Bay, there is a very simple thing you can do: Find some of your old stuff that you want to sell, and post it on the market. Markets have gravity, so with more contracts posted, more people will start to use it."

        "To me personally I would rather see bay rise swiftly to the top 10 or top 5 via whatever method is reasonable and shown to work with other projects. I would then like to see bay self fund mobile versions and anon options from that huge cap. Then reverse back to a 1-2% pos level after the peg. To have a high price/demand before the peg will be key. I take your points on masternodes and do not really like them however the economic effect is beyond doubt very very powerful. Long term yes increased emission is bad but most people (big investors i have seen on this board reject bay) is because the loyalty effect is just not there yet for such a large minting, they see that people just keep trying to sell and jump back in. If that action was going to cost them on POS staking enough it is not worth the risk to keep doing that. Perhaps not just the number of coins you hold but the duration of holding without any withdrawals at all should be the multiplier here for the time being. Masternodes are not great either because most end up on a few vps so security is weak. Just boosting pos % slightly to encourage more holding and saving is great short term and any increased emission will be far out weighted by the cost increase. This can be temporary just to boost price mc position and attention.  We need to reach the tipping point and that point is coming even as things are but to get further faster and have as high a price / high demand as possible before the peg is vital. \u00a0I know with bay we like to say things are fads or not important or not correct but coins that have no worries jumping on these fads are worth magnitudes more and offer nothing accept these fads. Part of being successful is not just excelling at what is important it is also taking away any reason to look elsewhere at all. If we had everything these fads offer then what is the point of going anywhere but bay. People are hopping on these masternode/anon variable POS coins for short term pumps I agree. However some will use this influx of investment to fund tech that will keep a lot of them onboard. I hear people every day telling me anon and masternodes are fads but they are also telling me they are investing for short term pumps and profits. However those coins with 10% development funds are taking 10% of all this influx and using it to create new tech that could be very useful. You need whales and pumps and fads. These are useful tools if you use them correctly. Trying to avoid these things is a mistake. Bay deserves even to be a top 10 or top 5 coin. The only reason it is not is because we don't have whales and pump teams and marketing teams and fads people want. We could be extracting this pump fad wealth to fund the missing pieces of the bay puzzle....mobile, anon, etc The only issue with the slowly slowly route is that those projects that have no qualms about jumping on fads, pumps and other vehicles will take funding your project should be attracting. There is the fast route there is the slow route. Sometimes although the slow route seems guaranteed to take you further it does not sadly in this world. Most projects in the top 20 are selling dreams and fads. We have the tech we just aren't selling it well enough right now. Camp dash are marketing and networking pro's. Eth are even more so. Look at ethereums planned POS i mean you need a fortune to stake at all right?  Right now every rise is purely due to the tech and davids coding. Throw in a few fads, attract a few whales, get a few big pumps then when we are worth 500M we can worry about the long term emissions. I agree post things on the market place, use it for competitions, lotteries anything really it can be used for so much. Anyway bay will reach way higher soon even as it is i just think it should be top 5 not top 75."

It does create more work but it keeps the community engaged. I'm voting against it lol. So because I hold a lot of coins will not be easy to defeat. With that said getting everyone to move to POS 3 took time and was stressful updating all the nodes. As for increasing stake reward in a master node style thing. As it stands I'm not a fan of inflation. I think the pegging will already create competition for frozen coins since they give more vote power and you can get them at a discount. So why fix what isn't broken?"

        "The first official BitBay decentralized voting poll is live! For any new forum members we are casting votes to determine whether or not we should fix a stake reward glitch now or later. To fix it will require a fork in the chain. It appears the developer is the only one who wants to wait, yet I can't even find him voting currently! \u00a0 Voting started at 7:00am UTC today. If you wish to use your client to count votes, goto: Settings -> General Settings - > Mining/Staking Voting tab -> click on count votes and enter either: stakefork \u00a0 or \u00a0 nostakefork \u00a0 as your text string to count. Then you can enter the starting block when the voting poll officially began = 1135273 And then enter the most current block as an ending vote.  The Client will then scan the blockchain and tally up the votes for each text string. Remember votes are only cast on staked blocks so they are not easy to be cast. Yet this affects everyone on an even level. So the sooner you start and the more coins you have, the better the chance your voice will be heard! The voting poll ends 4/4/17 7:00 am UTC The last official vote block found before that deadline will will a 5000 coin prize! You don't have to use the client to track the votes cast. You can also use the blockchain. All votes goto a burn address. stakefork vote address is: \u00a0https://chainz.cryptoid.info/bay/address.dws?bPFjpZ3TwVJHudKrhxzqb9oPDvhBsQBtPV.htm Remember votes are only counted after official start of poll. So the first vote block found is  \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  Again, I currently can't find anyone casting votes for:\u00a0 nostakefork If that is your desire you better get started ASAP.

However I also do not think we should start this democracy with David casting votes with 100M coins. It will set a bad president for the democratic nature of the voting mechanism. You can guarantee at this stage less than 25% of coins will be put to use for voting so a 10% chunk voting at this point is a certain victory for whatever way david votes. It almost nulls the point of having a vote. I would suggest for the sake of democracy no voting by the dev until bay is way more popular and 10% is not such a huge factor. Rather we just listen to his reasons for a no fork vote more carefully.  From a selfish POV david could vote for a fork because with 100M bay he stands to accumulate more than anyone else. He must have a good reason for casting a non fork vote.  I'd rather push ahead with the project rather than doing another fork right now. Hopefully the pegging will come forth and the next upgrade or update we fix the interest rate."

This tech removes the middleman from the equation 100%! Shadowcash is attempting to create the same tech for their marketplace, and it honors David knowing that others like Shadowcash see the power of removing the middleman completely out of the equation. I don't know how far along they are with their progress. And now they are transforming into Particl. Wish them the best of luck. But either way, I don't know if they plan to ever try to implement a rolling peg protocol to their current design. The whitepaper for the rolling peg will be released in a few months. It is already completed, we just don't want to release it yet until we get closer to it's implementation. So stick around, buy on the dips and keep accumulating till the rolling peg gets here.

        "Hopefully they will be testing soon. But yeah I agree, this will open the door for a lot of possibilities! And hopefully the elite exchanges that could care less about innovating, will come to realize the term, \"evolve or die\". Once BitBay completes the rolling peg, we could be a huge asset for Blocknet's exchange as I'd love to see them also create a trustless or semi-trustless loaning service for margin trading. Margin trading requires a stable currency as a base to loan out leverage. Fiat is out of the question, regulation is just too retard to follow. After BitBay implements the rolling peg, the stability factor would match it perfect for such a setup with Blocknet. And if such a design needed deposits (I don't know for sure), we could still deposit BitBay to the Blocknet exchange through a semi-trustless joint account system that David's already added to the Halo Client.  It's basically a multi-signature wallet. The loaner would hold 1 key and the exchange would hold one key. All transfers must first be approved by either the loaner or the exchange. And for extra security the exchange\u00a0 could add 2fa as well.  And if I'm correct on my assumption, since we will soon have the locktime / parked coins feature, we can basically setup an joint account loan with Blocknet that auto expires after a set time, i.e., 1 month, 3 months, etc. So this way if they somehow lost their key to your joint account wallet, you'd still get them back once the account expires.  And to top that all off with the fact that joint accounts can stake! And they can stake without running into the security risk mining pools create, since joint accounts are independent of each other. So if a semi-trustless margin trading loaning service was provided, not only would loaners earn interest from loaning to leverage traders, they could also safely earn stake reward in the process! And since BitBay is implementing a rolling peg, and not a hard peg, price still has the potential to fluctuate under stable conditions. So loaners have the potential of compounding their interest earnings on multiple fronts! So without a need for fiat red tape regulation, margin trading can now existing via 100% cryptocurrency backing and at a minimum of a semi-trustless security protocol, which is exponentially more secure than what status quo exchanges currently provide! It's time the elite exchanges start to wake up! They are running out of time!"

Bitmessage could (potentially) be better since there is no servers. Any time you use clearnet, you have absolutely no freedom. So I think you don't really understand the definition of decentralized. And nothing is decentralized when you give your home mailing address. \u00a0 But keep on mumbling to yourself in your corner, if you do you might eventually believe your own bullshit."

The problem is a lot of people got this coin for like 20 -50 sats so of course they keep dumping and buying back in over and over. I keep watching this happen.

I edited my post above, I haven't like totally dissected the script but yeah at first glance looks good. The CLTV is there. Its saying if the time is one way it goes to the one account if its the other way it goes to the other account. There is a hash in there to redeem it most likely the hash of the secret that unlocks the TX which when published unlocks the TX on the other chain... I suppose if we want to get technical we should see if that hash is the same as the one used on that SYS transaction by decoding their transaction. But like the online decoder isn't really pretty but then again i just dumped the whole TX on it. But that online decoder is really messy... I would have to decode it elsewhere and look more closely at it when I wake up. But yeah seems like its okay so far."

This is nothing like that, this is fully decentralized AND dynamic. First of all votes are counted a few times per day. The markets client already has voting and we used it to decide on a fork. The ones invested are the ones who have a vested interest in price, volume, stability. Also you can do freezing based on an algorithm. It's not opt in like Nubits, its forced. A person with 100 coins who hasn't moved it since it froze 50% when moving it sets aside 50 as frozen and 50 as liquid. The transfer of the liquid coins is thus immediate. If the coins inflate those 50 become more liquid and his frozen 50 become gradually available 1/50th for each 1% increase. The amount of times we count the vote will determine how fast the coins freezes and unfreezes. If we count 24 times a day and each movement is 1% then it could be 24% (compound) inflation or deflation. If we only count the votes once per day at a change of 1% it is thus 1% max a day. You will all get the option to download a \"demo\" client where we can force the freeze on client side so we can all play with it and get an idea for what is going to be the most reasonable freezing system. These variables are absolutely critical. Its makes a big difference how often votes are counted, how much it deflates in each step etc. Also there is a way to bypass the law entirely with frozen funds as they can be moved \"slowly\" so they are really \"slowed funds\". The slowed funds can be moved under the condition that they are locked for 1 month. I used to think 3 but am now thinking of making it 1. We should decide on that time span too because everything makes a difference."

So only a low volume coin (might) have a lower effective marketcap. And you would definitely want it that way because you don't want supply to so far beyond demand of the target price! This is the entire problem with Crypto!! They don't have any way to truly EMULATE larger markets. Forcing stability and consumer confidence. Also, this is a massive benefit over hard pegs that rely on \"trading tricks\" and insanely unstable voluntary incentives (like parking) not to say we can't offer \"bonds\" like parking but this is truly the only decentralized free and fair way to do it. There can certainly be two asset classes within the same \"asset\" as you call it because of the way I'm going to have miners analyse the coins being spent. They can force the division of the two by looking at prospective outputs and force you to make change on the ones not leaving your account. Although I've put together a very technical 20 page whitepaper, not yet published so its a lot more complex than I'm letting on. Thus there are two styles of assets on the same chain. The frozen coins and the liquid ones. The frozen coins can thaw and become liquid quite fast if the volume rises and the price rises based on the communities collective wishes. And they would certainly want to freeze some of the supply if price goes too low and that my friend should increase volume!! Why? Because a person buying liquid coins knows a certain amount will be more valuable by watching the voting rate. If hes long on BitBay he will want this. Also, once it reaches a stable target price volume again will increase because people know when Bitcoin goes down, they have a stable hedge far superior than the broken Tether!! Yes Tether went below a dollar proving yet again 3rd parties cannot be trusted. So it would be wise for an investor to quickly cash out BTC for BitBay because they can wait in BitBay as they watch BTC decline. And even potentially watch Bays value rise because the peg is \"rolling\" or \"moving\" and not fixed. This dynamic system is exactly the same as how governments do it with the caveat that its decentralized and all users are in control (or an algorithm can handle it too). In my opinion its what Bitcoin should have been. Regardless we shall see soon enough! Fun times ahead. \"Rolling peg\" is what I used to describe it. But also \"moving peg\", \"user value protection\", \"freezing/unfreezing\", \"inflation/deflation\" were some of the names tossed around. Let me know if you can think of other names for this as it's never been done before."

So there is a few pages of my whitepaper listing multiple strategies for dealing with them. Ideally they run the API and query balance of frozen and liquid with it. The more data they supply about trades the less of a melting pot it becomes. A user would have two balances frozen and liquid. We can then handle somewhat inaccurate API calls that mix liquidity or super accurate ones that check the trades. The worst case scenario we allow full withdraw with the one month time lock to move the partially frozen chunks but that is only if we get desperate because then like you said people with their money on the exchange early have the unfair edge. You might tempt them with arbitrage elsewhere but really we want co-operative exchanges. There are a few that will work with us I think. We may end up turning a small exchange into a big one. The other way is rely on decentralized exchanges which literally move the funds like (hopefully) Blocknet or Komodo assuming either of them get popular."

        "I don't doubt at all what you are saying. However with regard the rush this is kind of like a race. So far a lot of huge huge projects with massive funding behind them have only sold hype and dreams. There is nothing tangible there with those projects at all. However they are leveraging this hype and dream selling into a funding pot that takes investment/attention from other good real projects like bitbay. The trouble is once people believe they are part of a community and support the dreams and hype projects it can be difficult to get them to extract their investment and put it in a real project that does not sell dreams and hype. Look at the top 20 MC which of those projects are still pretty much vapour ware. Now imagine forcing all those investors to forget hype and dreams and put those funds in to real projects... bay would be a top 5 coin for sure. I like the sound of incentivising people to lock the coins down in the marketplace for periods of time indeed. Hopefully in certain sized packets to achieve scaling rewards.  Anyway things are going well up another bump today.  Soon bay will be a stable inside the top 50 , next step stable within the top 20. I'm really hoping bay will be recognised and become stable top 10 by the end of the year. The great thing about the peg is that once we are psychologically accepted in the top 10 we will enforce our place there not just because the usefulness of all the other features but also as a safe haven of stability of value. Same for top 5. I can see bay being the base currency for a lot of exchanges in the future because of this stability.  I heard the owner of polo was a music grad with little coding or tech skill. Makes me wonder if bay could start its own exchange with bay as the base currency pretty soon. There must be some tech based people in the core other than david and off the shelf exchange scripts too. all fees go into repurchasing bay from the market and burning them so upward pressure is always there too. Giving us more scope to rise inflation for those accumulating and holding through a ranking system."

You should familiarize yourself with the rolling peg which can freeze and unfreeze supply which will be able to control the price. Before that I've got a bunch of updates to the existing templates which already can do pretty much anything you need it to do. The cash for coins template for example is a trustless way to buy Bitcoin or BitBay with cash/fiat using double deposit and unbreakable contracts. Since the contracts can't be broken there is no arbiter, middlemen, or fees to a big company. Its just peer to peer cash deals allowing anyone anywhere in the world to buy any coin they want."

This shouldn't affect market cap, however, because we're decreasing the supply to increase the spot price, and increasing the supply to decrease spot price. Since market cap = (supply x spot price), in theory, we should be able to keep the price constant. My questions: 1. At what frequency is the liquid supply updated? It's not uncommon for crypto to have \u00b110% in a few minutes, and this could be troublesome for a consistent peg. 2. Is voting really going to be effective enough to keep track? It seems like it would be a full time job to constantly adjust the liquid supply manually. 3. Does the existence of illiquid supply affect the demand in any passive way? The dynamics here seem complex. 4. Will we ever get into a situation where BAY will be locked away indefinitely, in a sort of \"checkmate\" between keeping the peg consistent, and the inevitability of a drop in demand if the peg were to change (to release illiquid funds)?"

Your other 3 options are: \u00a0- Vote to Deflate \u00a0- Vote to Inflate - \u00a0Vote to Maintain Supply If you select any of the bottom 3 you will need to cast a vote to let your voice be heard. All that requires from this point on is that you stake your Client \u00a0 If you change your mind in the future you simply change the setting. It's that simple!  The voting could technically be counted 24 times a day . . once an hour. meaning 24% compound + or - in either freeze or thaw. That is really aggressive and can force a pretty stable price or if we want a bit more play or slow and gradual rolling peg the temperment of 2-5% maximum per day (counting votes 5 times a day) is much more slow freeze  please keep in mind this is on going discussions as its never been done before.

        "Thanks for remembering those details. Also I should add to automate the vote would be what most people will do. I was thinking we might have to add another option to that dropdown box which is \"vote towards target\" and have them vote to a target supply or price. Its possible to only let those decisions for each user run for a week or so to force them to occasionally check the software again to recast it. These are mostly user interface decisions but not protocol. The idea of how centric do we want to make an algorithm gets closer to the heart of protocol. Actually the frozen supply can effect demand in a good way. There is a bylaw being added to allow transfer of frozen supply on the condition it is locked in a 1 month time lock. This \"slows\" the frozen funds so you could just say there are variable speeds of liquidity. The slowed funds are used for bonds, credit swaps or trustless loans and really all kinds of cool instruments never before thought possible in crypto. If there becomes a speculative market, i would think the frozen/slowed funds would become the speculative market. Because those give access to voting power, can be staked for interest and also serve as a future. It will be one helluva fun trading game. I can see the peg falling into the situation you described. A few potential risks is it is deflated too much so the price goes way too high and cannot be recovered to that target. Another risk is the network can't agree on a supply so it gets stuck at a certain level. But consider that there is always changes to the economy and the ones holding. So most likely it would never really get stuck at a specific supply. Someone who buys up 100% of the liquidity would end up seeing the supply inflate. So i think as long as there is consistent demand that is something we shouldn't worry about. But lets say this happens. Then we would want to consider forking to update the algorithms perhaps?! The cool part about this is that its an awesome social experiment so we can see how it goes and adjust and get inspired to improve upon it with better algorithms.  In theory, we can do it based purely on algorithms without voting but for now I really like combining the two."

        "If you ask for the #1 complaint of merchants accepting bitcoin as a payment option is that they fear its volatility. Their cash flow comes first and foremost, which means they can't afford to hold bitcoin if they sell items for bitcoin and then wake up one morning to see the price of bitcoin is down 5-10% because, for example, the damn Chinese government all of a sudden decides to manipulate the price through new unexpected regulation laws. Merchants must retain their profits to stay afloat. So they typically do the most obvious solution, which is to cash out to fiat as soon as the transaction is complete. The rolling peg will solve this. The goal of the rolling peg, in my opinion, it to provide a solution where the price of the coin can still fluctuate, but in a much more stabilized environment. My hopes are that it would become even more stable than most of the forex 'majors'."

Also this coin is ahead of anything out there maybe even to ahead. 1k sats thats nothing i dont think the tru potential of this innovation of the rolling peg is being realized. I have been looking for someone to impliment a idea like this. Finally a dev that realizes how the real world/finance works. Wonder if dev has a financial backround? Even if it was taken from another place still the dev had the forsight to tinker and impliment it.  If it was everything with out peg it would be just another coin with added benifits. I see a great future with this coin. To Dev: ur right the cutting supply was not a good comment in heighnsight. But the rolling peg does esentially that as in It adj the supply"

        "Well Ethereum has funding and we don't. BitHalo was before Ethereum and BitBay is the coin made based on Halo. The reason we are higher than them is because the idiot founders stole the funds to harm BitHalo and my rep so we had to operate for 2 years without funding. That makes is hard for me to market and code. Eth has 10 marketers for each coder and i think they don't really even care about making a product. They raised 100+million easy especially now with the spike and their user interface is a joke compared to the one we have here which was essentially free. So honestly if we had funding we would have solved all of cryptos issues by now. But the good news is, things have been working in our favor lately, the founders are a distant memory, BitBay slack has around 500 members and we see new ones daily and honestly this is a great start considering the peg hasn't even started yet. Also the amount of BitBay that gets frozen has nothing to do with how much you hold. If you have 10 coins at $1 and 50% freeze you have 5 frozen and 5 liquid. If the price rises due to that freeze to $2 then you still have $10 liquid and now more money frozen except the frozen funds are a more speculative price (potentially another 10 dollars). If someone has 100,000 coins and its worth $1 and 50% freeze they have 50k frozen and liquid at $2 is still 100k So the freeze doesn't have anything to do with how many coins you hold. It works fairly for everyone. Be happy you are early and can hold coins when they are fully liquid as its a nice advantage to be early. Unfortunately BTER owner is a theif. In addition to the problems we had with them, they also stole millions of btc in a \"hack\" later, dumped their bay and delisted it. If you want it back you will have to talk to the owner Lin or try filing a ticket or complaint with them. To be honest, i'm shocked the exchange still exists after everything they have done."

There are worse coins pumping far harder. I quite like doge. It works well for what it is meant to achieve anyway. Bay of course is superior in every way except for community size and also we don't have much in the way of exchanges right now. I notice blackcoin rising past us. That is particularly strange because without halo why would you go for blackcoin over bitbay. I find it strange their cap is higher than bitbays. I sold most of mine to get bitbay. Good move of course since bitbay was practically nothing then. I see they are mentioning they have cold staking now. Kind of annoying. Do they have the voting system too? How can we stop them attracting investors away from bitbay with tech they are getting for free? We need to ensure their version of halo is not as advanced as bitbays. If i had my way I would extract halo from them altogether. True story. I was chatting to someone with a 5k BTC portfolio with no bitbay?? when i asked why he said bitbay has nothing of its own.. you have blackcoins codebase and halo neither is bitbay exclusive so you have nothing. He has millions of sys coins because he wants exclusive tech? but then sys is open source code so how is that exclusive? Im not saying its a bad project and is in fact good but no chance worth 3x bay. Anyway something needs to be done about this issue really. These are not the first people to have said similar things to me when I try to get them over to bitbay or at least to get some bitbay in their portfolio even if they are not going to go wild on any one project. Any word on something new coming out for bitbay. Something we can boast is a big first without blackcoin saying snap straight after? This thread looks a bit slow too. I appreciate slack is useful but there is a huge influx of new people arriving here. This thread should be on page 1 of the ANN section really at all times. We should be discussing features and who we can market them to on here constantly. I know david is busy coding but where are the rest of the core? How many people are in the core and who are they on this board?"

        "I absolutely agree. BAY is one of the best projects out there. A true top 5 contender. It almost has an endless amount of features. Some which are/will only be exclusive to BAY. The rolling peg will be a total game changer. Like Cryptohunter said, I am shocked that Syscoin is so much more than BAY and that Blackcoin is even around us. BAY is the best of the bunch, imo.  Here is a giant list of a bunch of features one of us compiled a few months ago. It probably has more as of today and is still growing. *Unbreakable contracts (Peer to Peer no blockchain bloat) *Decentralized Anonymous Markets (Peer to Peer no blockchain bloat stronger than Tor) *Multisignature wallets with dual passwords hidden inside of PNG/JPG images using steganography *Automated Joint accounts and the ability to sign transactions with 2 computers (hard core security) *User Friendly Templates for contracts *Training videos *Ability to hide any file in an image *IMAP under the hood full integration with Email, automated negotiation of contracts *Price tracking so orders always maintain price *Bitmessage fully integrated decentralized email and markets *Translates to 92 languages using Google Translate *Unique change management system which breaks all the change into denominations *Easy to use accounting panel *Live Python Debugger, run the interpreter within the software *Advanced sending with multipay options *\"Pay To Email\" tipping system. Hide payments in images direct to email. *Everything is automated *Full Offer/Counter-Offer negotiation system. *Escrow panel with tons of options, anonymous chat *Feedback and reputation system, see how many contracts gained and lost *Serverless, everything is Peer to Peer *Decentralized moderation keys available to trusted users *Custom contracts and all kinds of contact options *Start your own market, completely anonymous *Cash for coins template *Custom contract template (can do anything you want if you are familiar with it) Implications of DDE(Double Deposit Escrow) Smart Contracts and their use cases: Decentralized \"Local Bitcoins\": Send wires without the fear of theft due to Double deposit Decentralized exchange of cash for coins Buy/Sell anything without \"Empty Box Scam\" NO ARBITER NEEDED. It is self enforcing trade even with untrusted parties So it works like a decentralized trustless ebay... NO MIDDLEMEN, NO ESCROW NEEDED Works like decentralized Freelancer/Odesk Unbreakable Employee contracts. FORCE people to HONOR their word! No more unreliable employees, employers forced to pay as well. Barter ANYTHING. Use the coins only as self-assurance. Form a farm co-op trade Gold for Silver, Iron for Wheat. No need to use coins can decouple completely from currency. Some of the templates are still being worked on to make it \"Mom friendly\" so that it takes as few clicks as possible to form a contract. No need to think of \"terms and conditions\" contracts are anonymous and self-enforcing. Here is some of the features that we are working on in 2017: *Exotic spending... we will have the worlds first client to support time locks in the UI, deadmans switch and burn and parking and freezing coins all supported within the UI. *Cold Staking for both BitBay and BlackHalo... stake using two computers, impossible to hack. Its basically joint account staking *Custom Staking with Voting! Completely trustless voting and donations via staking. *Anti-Keylogger: A special on-screen keyboard to obliterate keyloggers once and for all. Even mouse movement loggers will be no match for this unless every movement is recorded *Tor and proxy options for internet requests *Buy/Sell template featuring multiple shipping options including a calculator and options to bill in escrow *Employment template featuring the ability for weekly reports and auto-payment within contract. Payments contingent on reports *Barter contract with amazing \"wish list\" where each item can be calculated converting kilograms to hours and ability to know exactly how many \"Avocados\" you need for a pound of \"Tomatoes\". Perfect for farming co-op in 3rd world countries. Perfect for trading used items! *Reverse auctions! Sellers bid for you the buyer *Normal Auctions... Ebay style decentralized auctions *Python contracts: Use the python interpreter to make contracts between peers. Pre-approved contracts potentially possible for verified devs and audited code on github. *API And more! If the right people new about this, BAY would explode.

So cryptohunter your friend is incorrect to hold so much Sys when they have centralized arbiter and doesn't solve any real world problems. He needs to understand that BitHalo only gets bug updates from here forward. Exotic spending and all the remaining templates go here only until potentially a long time after pegging. Whatever achieves maximum impact for the people invested here. Currently, investing in Bitbay is no the only way to truly invest in Halo. I don't control Blackcoins codebase and since people here invested in Halo directly they deserve to see it succeed. BitHalo/BlackHalo is still my product and baby but we have the rolling peg and a lot of other things here.  Also our markets work and have hundreds of little features that Sys doesn't have. So it's a bit funny to me to see the projects being compared. If you have trustless markets you need trustless escrow or your markets simply aren't trustless."

Need a bunch more real investors not the churning pest day traders. Look at this today, this typical of people constantly churning and selling hoping to get back in lower. Hope they get priced out and left behind. These are not real long term investors that have an interest in the project at all. I really hope we will come up with something that will attract accumulation and long term holding asap. We need tiers and ranks. People like to aim for something and get a rank too with a decent reward. Seen it done successfully in a few other projects too. The psychological element can not be underestimated. As soon as a person buys some up a bunch of churners are dumping and buying back lower because weak hands with no incentive to hold are dumping to them on any moves. We need to get rid of day traders and scalpers as much as we can and encourage long term holding and saving of the tokens."

I don't care much for slack this board is more important to me it keeps bay highly visible for incoming new investors. To me this board is crypto central and you want to look active and interesting on here. I know slack is good for the dev side of things.  I think in return they are privy to the latest ideas and updates before the rest of the people get to know. However I mean if what bay already has and we know is coming is not enough reason to hold and accumulate then of course there is no alt worth holding or accumulating."

Working out the details for this has been a challenge due to firewalls and dynamic IP addresses, but once it is completed in a future release, we will provide you with the information you need to make it work for you. I will make a detailed screenshot tutorial in the near future. Been so busy with other duties.  To cold stake with 2 computers in the same LAN, they both need a Client running.  In the Settings tab, click on General Settings, then click on Mining/Staking Voting tab. Inside you will see another tab called Staking Multiple Accounts, in this window you can add an account. Load up one private key and click cancel when it asks you to load the 2nd key). Then do the same procedure on your other computer, yet when asked to load up key, you will load up the 2nd key and then cancel out for 2nd option to load key. That way you would have one account. To create one account in BitBay's Client, you need 2 keys paired to each other. So one computer would have one key out of the pair, and the other computer would have the other key out of the pair. This makes a complete account yet between 2 computers.  You need to know the lan ip address of one of the computers. Once you know this address you simply enter it into the other computers Client. To do this go to Settings tab, click on general settings, then click on the Mining/Staking Voting tab In this section you will see a field that lets you enter the ip address of the other computer you wish to connect to. If for some reason it can't connect it will let you know. Otherwise, once you enter the ip address, you can close out the window and your now cold staking!"

        "The 2 main focal points are price stability and trustless transactions. The whole point of satoshi's dream was to create something to remove the middleman out of the equation in regards to controlling your money and doing business with others. Bitcoin was a great start, but it isn't a complete product. 99% of all types of services provided for cryptocurrencies still require some form of trust and 3rd party affiliate - which means middlemen are still needed. With BitBay, we can finally remove middlemen out of the equation for any sort of transaction - whether it's selling piggycoins for dogecoins, bitcoins for a camera, 500 pounds of avocados for 300 pounds of corn.  BitBays utilizes a collateral/deposit system that is completely automated, so there is no need for a middleman to be involved to try to act like they can keep people honest with each other. Let's be frank, it's impossible for a middleman to know who's stiffing who when a transactions goes bad. So how does one fix that? By removing the potential for scammers to be able to profit. In BitBay, if a counterparty tries to scam you, they lose their deposit. It has customizable levels for deposits as well - so for example, if you want to sell a camera, yet you don't really have a good feeling about the person interested in buying it, yOu could essentially make them deposit even more than what the item for sale is worth - now they take even more risk than you.  It's pretty simple... if a scammer can't profit, then why try to scam. And the way it is designed is that it focuses on keeping the blockchain free from unnecessary bloat. If bitcoin is already having a hard enough time as it is with their blockchain transactions and memory issues, can you imagine what's going to happen to other cryptocurrencies that try to store more than just transactions on their blockchain?"

Hide payments in images direct to email. * Everything is automated * Full Offer/Counter-Offer negotiation system. * Escrow panel with tons of options, anonymous chat * Feedback and reputation system, see how many contracts gained and lost * Serverless, everything is Peer to Peer * Decentralized moderation keys available to trusted users * Custom contracts and all kinds of contact options * Start your own market, completely anonymous * Cash for coins template * Custom contract template (can do anything you want if you are familiar with it) * Implications of DDE(Double Deposit Escrow) Smart Contracts and their use cases: * Decentralized \"Local Bitcoins\": Send wires without the fear of theft due to Double deposit * Decentralized exchange of cash for coins * Buy/Sell anything without \"Empty Box Scam\" NO ARBITER NEEDED. It is self enforcing trade even with untrusted parties. So it works like a decentralized trustless ebay... NO MIDDLEMEN, NO ESCROW NEEDED  \u00a0\u00a0Works like decentralized Freelancer/Odesk * Unbreakable Employee contracts. FORCE people to HONOR their word! No more unreliable employees, employers forced to pay as well. * Barter ANYTHING. Use the coins only as self-assurance. Form a farm co-op trade Gold for Silver, Iron for Wheat. No need to use coins can decouple completely from currency. Some of the templates are still being  \u00a0\u00a0 worked on to make it \"Mom friendly\" so that it takes as few clicks as possible to form a contract. No need to think of \"terms and conditions\" contracts are anonymous and self-enforcing.  Here are some of the features that we are working on in 2017: * Exotic spending... we will have the worlds first client to support time locks in the UI, deadmans switch and burn and parking and freezing coins all supported within the UI. * Cold Staking for both BitBay and BlackHalo... stake using two computers, impossible to hack. Its basically joint account staking * Custom Staking with Voting! Completely trustless voting and donations via staking. * Anti-Keylogger: A special on-screen keyboard to obliterate keyloggers once and for all. Even mouse movement loggers will be no match for this unless every movement is recorded * Tor and proxy options for internet requests * Buy/Sell template featuring multiple shipping options including a calculator and options to bill in escrow * Employment template featuring the ability for weekly reports and auto-payment within contract. Payments contingent on reports * Barter contract with amazing \"wish list\" where each item can be calculated converting kilograms to hours and ability to know exactly how many \"Avocados\" you need for a pound of \"Tomatoes\". Perfect for farming  \u00a0\u00a0co-op in 3rd world countries. Perfect for trading used items! * Reverse auctions! Sellers bid for you the buyer * Normal Auctions... Ebay style decentralized auctions * Python contracts: Use the python interpreter to make contracts between peers. Pre-approved contracts potentially possible for verified devs and audited code on github. * API And more!\" I think that about covers it...."

I like the idea of website apps that can use BitBay under the hood and even include semi-trustless multisig accounts with deadman-switch that would provide auto-signatures for withdraws back to your account after a certain agreed upon time-frame. That way if anything were to happen with the host holding 1 of 2 of the multisig keys, they couldn't accidentally lose the key and thus basically turn the account into a burn address. Throw some provable app verification hashes into the mix, some zeronet backup hosts, and you've got a decent product that can provide either trustless or semitrustless transactions! It's coming! \u00a0 The best part is that you can keep the economic system simplified. The term petrodollar has a very important meaning to it - mainly being that trading oil with 'one' currency makes life easier for everybody. Having 500 dapps each with their own token, just doesn't seem like a logical way to run business with any sense of scalability. Sure it's great for investors because they are diversified.

I know slack is far better for certain things and those that have any kind of tech prowess or something to offer in that area then slack is the place. The questions I ask here on the thread although could probably be avoided if i was on slack are perfect for the thread\u00a0 ...because the vast majority of new people joining or those not yet dedicated enough to bay are browsing this forum and it serves to keep the thread on page one and perhaps spark up discussion on thread\u00a0 regarding points of distinct interest to would be investors and future community members. To me anyway bay is so interesting and so vast in its scope that I just feel getting eyeballs on bay is enough to make others feel the same and get involved in some way even if it is just investing a bit of btc and holding. I notice on the majority of projects where they reject the bct thread as their main medium of community interaction then the project can seem to suffer."

        "The BitBay team had a meeting May 7th, and decided it is time to reorganize the team.  Uptil now the team has had a very flat structure, and we will keep it that way as much as possible. However the team is now 15 people and growing, and that calls for a little more structure. The decision was to announce all positions except community manager (shared by Craig and Munti/sirlosealot) as vacant, and let the old and potential new team members apply for those. Rule of thumb is that no one is paid to be part of the team. We will however be willing to hire needed skill sets short term as needed. We will also announce an extensive bounty list once the process of filling team positions is done. Applications to join the team are sent to Craig or Munti/sirlosealot. In addition to stating what position you apply for, please describe your skill set as accurately as possible. Also give us an estimate of how much time you are able/willing to spend. We would also like you to tell us what you lack in an ideal skill set for the position you are applying for. The following list of positions is our starting point. It may be altered based on the applications, and some positions may also be split between several people. Especially head of marketing and web dev are positions we might need to split in order to get all the skill sets required. \u00a0- We are looking for someone that is able to take us through a branding process and make a marketing plan. This would include being able to identify where we are in the development cycle, identifying target groups for different stages of development, knowledge of what channels to use to reach target group, etc. Experience with low budget marketing is required. \u00a0- We are looking for someone who has in depth knowledge for one or more of the areas that is relevant for head of marketing, or alternatively someone with good all-around knowledge in most of them, but not enough time or experience to fill Head of marketing.  \u00a0- We need web dev with good all-around knowledge. We use wordpress (and are likely to continue doing so), so in depth knowledge of wordpress is important. Security and SEO are also key areas. \u00a0- we are looking for someone to plan and execute events like treasure hunts, pay2email campaigns, etc. Creativity and accuracy are important skills beside knowing the client extremely well. \u00a0- We are looking for someone to build, maintain, and expand BitBay communities in other languages than english. Chinese, spanish, and russian are top of our priority list, but we are of course open to other suggestions as well. \u00a0- We are looking for someone that already has good all-around knowledge about crypto, and also has (or will acquire) in depth knowledge of our software. Support manager will build our entire support system together with community managers.  \u00a0- we are looking for someone that can see to it that our marketplace is populated with contracts. This can either be done by filling it yourself, or by actively getting others to fill it. Maybe a combination. Minimum goals will be set for this. \u00a0- We are looking for someone to manage all or part of our social media, and also bring us to new arenas. Decent writing skills are a must. \u00a0- We are looking for several writers.  \u00a0- We need graphic designer to produce both for marketing and tutoring. \u00a0- We need video producer to produce both for marketing and tutoring. ur marketplace gets filled with contracts, either by filling it himself, or by getting others to fill it. The ambition should be that we always have a minimum of 100 contracts in the market to begin with, and increase it from there. \u00a0- We are always interested in dev help here. For now it\u0092s probably most efficient that David keeps coding the new features, but there are other things to be done too. We could use someone that is good with UI and UX. Skill with Qt designer is needed for this. We are also interested in any dev help that starts the process of developing mobile and web interface. \u00a0- We are looking for people that don\u0092t necessarily fit in one of the above descriptions, but who think they can make a contribution anyway -either because of skills not mentioned here, or because they are quick on their feet and can get things done when they are handed a task. Did we forget any positions? Feel free to bring it up Join our slack if you have not done so already   and shot me a pm if you want to help out"

Which means you have to have a trade history with them or you have to enter a valid phone number (for the sake of protection against bots) Any help from the community on this matter would be much appreciated.

This release mainly focuses on performance upgrades and fine tuning the Client\u00e2\u0080\u0099s many features. It will allow David the ability from here on out to focus solely on coding the final features of the core build. Halo Version 1.27 updates include: \u00e2\u0080\u00a2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Added admin method to build into manifest \u00e2\u0080\u00a2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Made it so pastebin can be updated for existing orders with missing images on resubmit \u00e2\u0080\u00a2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Started to track memory leaks for better performance \u00e2\u0080\u00a2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Checked data type for querying history in case of erroneous data \u00e2\u0080\u00a2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Checked data being returned from Electrum in BitHalo raw tx in case of erroneous data \u00e2\u0080\u00a2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Added splash screen for submitting TX and also added wait function for waiting for download thread to unlock causing false rejections \u00e2\u0080\u00a2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Added splash for image compression during upload \u00e2\u0080\u00a2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fixed balance issue in multistake on same input \u00e2\u0080\u00a2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fixed issue where the number of keys connected changes too early \u00e2\u0080\u00a2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Wallet does not unlock for spending unless requested \u00e2\u0080\u0093 allowing for wallet to be unlocked for staking only. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Added image cache to make software more responsive because png conversion for computers without jpeg driver is slow \u00e2\u0080\u00a2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Added custom video library link per coin \u00e2\u0080\u00a2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Staking is now off by default so users must activate it manually. Since a new user might get confused when funds become unspendable upon deposit \u00e2\u0080\u00a2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Added sh file to build for Linux to (potentially) improve QT performance on some systems \u00e2\u0080\u00a2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fixed other minor user interface issues \u00e2\u0080\u00a2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Added extra tips for guiding new users \u00e2\u0080\u00a2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We now check for bitmessage timeouts \u00e2\u0080\u00a2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Reindex option added if daemon fails to load \u00e2\u0080\u00a2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Updated reputation system with redundant public key for resubmission to match original sender instead of temporary key \u00e2\u0080\u00a2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Users can now accept a market order with either bitmessage or email even if the original offer prefers email \u00e2\u0080\u00a2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Added more notifications for messages within escrow \u00e2\u0080\u00a2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Generate bitmessage addresses based on rpc password in addition to keys. In this way switching single keys that you load with won't generate a different address. This makes the address harder to figure out by looking at a script which is safer. Also, joint accounts now have a cleaner way of distinguishing their Bitmessage \u00e2\u0080\u00a2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Added foundation for basic market messaging to update orders. Now users can alert of a change in quantity \u00e2\u0080\u00a2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Verifying \"market messaging\" design needed for upcoming Buy/Sell Anything template auctions and various situations in Barter template The next update will include all Checklocktimeverify (CLTV) features. This will provide users with a CLTV functioning UI - the first of its kind for cryptocurrencies, and it will include the patch for fixing the POS 3.0 reward output which currently should equal 20.76 Bay per block found! After that David will release the API allowing for 3rd parties to utilize BitBay \u00e2\u0080\u0098under the hood\u00e2\u0080\u0099. This will allow for many undisclosed web based services. For example, imagine a website that utilizes BitBay to host a trustless Binary Options platform or a website host similar to localbitcoin.com for BitBay, yet completely trustless!  After that he can finally focus solely on the rolling peg protocol! Thanks for your support and community involvement. We are in progress of completing our marketing team and want to thank everyone who has requested an interview. We will provide an update on our progress in the near future!  We wish to spend some time to warn all Mac users that they must take extra precautions with downloading and installing a new version. As Mac users know, the Client currently runs a on a \u00e2\u0080\u009cWine\u00e2\u0080\u009d version of Windows. Therefore, we recommend you do not overwrite the existing Client. If a Mac user has their private keys saved inside the wine app, and then updates the Client to 1.27, they will lose all existing files inside. This is why it is imperative that you store your keys in multiple back up locations. You are responsible for your own wallet. In no way shape or form will we provide refunds to those that can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t properly manage their private keys. We have an easy solution for this in future updates along with a solution for this update as well. So please take the time to read through this notice so you are prepared when we release the official update.  Make backups of your private keys and make backups of important files such as Contracts.dat, Other.dat and you bitbaydata folder. Here is how to properly update BitBay on Mac: \u00ef\u0081\u00ae\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Instead of downloading the new Mac version of Client, download the windows version update at    \u00ef\u0081\u00ae\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Then Mac users will extract the update file called 'BitBayUpdate.exe' to the computer \u00ef\u0081\u00ae\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Then run WineSkin inside the app package \u00ef\u0081\u00ae\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Select 'Install Software' and click ' Choose Setup Executable ' then choose the BitBayUpdate.exe file \u00ef\u0081\u00ae\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After installation is complete do not launch BitBay and close the installer \u00ef\u0081\u00ae\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Wine might say that no new executables were found so just ignore that message and exit wine \u00ef\u0081\u00ae\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This will update Halo without overwriting the entire wine app or requiring you to resynchronize the blockchain. Most might not even notice the changes. It's definitely going to make it run more efficient In my opinion the major addition in this release is the ability to unlock the wallet for staking only."

Also having other exchanges allows for arbitration and a lot of people still like that game. Bittrex is good but would be good to have 5 or more really. Even when it was on bter it was worth the risk sometimes to grab cheap bay. Does bitbay have much of a chinese community?"

        "After consideration from community feedback, we have decided to pull support for the Mac QT wallet. As some of you know the wallet runs through a wine app which contains the wallet within the app package. On our site we tell users to back up their wallet and we also explain the location of the files and we have made announcements on how to update. However, if proper procedures are not taken and a user overwrites the app package, this deletes all existing files inside the app. And if by chance a Mac QT wallet user does not backup their wallet (outside the app) before the update is applied, then they will overwrite their existing wallet.dat file and lose their coins. All QT wallets will eventually become obsolete as the Halo Client will be the only wallet that can function with the rolling peg after it\u0092s implementation. For this reason, there has been very little emphasized applied to improving the QT wallets. \u00a0 \u00a0 For the sake of security, and from this point on, all Mac users will only be provided with access to the Halo Client. The QT wallet will still work, however we will not host the download anymore. Again, please do not replace the app package and always remember to backup your wallet. In the Halo/Markets wallet you should always back up your two keys. We can not stress the importance enough that even though cryptocurrencies provide a way for people of the world to manage their own money without the need for 3rd party entities, this freedom still requires a level of responsibility and the awareness to back up your wallets. In no way shape or form is the BitBay community responsible for any losses due to irresponsible actions."

In this case it could be better to have the API out before the peg so that value in the project will inflate to a much higher level before the pegging. So many user cases for bitbay but to code them all out in the most ergonomic way and user friendly way would be impossible for one person. If the api was out i think you would already see projects being built on top of bays platform by other developers. Website/mobile based user friendly services like sports betting, prediction markets, even currency exchange could all be developed to be super user friendly and decentralised and secure if running on top of bitbays market place. A good gateway from fiat in and out via a website that people are used to using is another great thing we could have. This is just an idea of course those who know more may have good reason to say it is best the pegging comes first."

        "What is multisig, and how does it work? Multisig is a way to let two or more people share control of a wallet. Each person will get their own key, and the wallet can only be accessed if the preset amount of key-holders unlock it. Multisig can also be used to increase the security of your wallet. For instance, you could set things up so you have to log on from two different computers, or require two separate keys which you store separately. Just always remember to back up both of your keys. Our wizard will guide you through the process. What is a smart contract, and how does it work? The term \u0093smart contract\u0094 is widely used now. The only definition of the term that we accept is a contract that is enforceable without middlemen. A smart contract should also be able to \"auto-execute\" and be able to sign on your behalf in certain conditions. Basically, it makes use of the multisig function and/or timelocking. The way we use it on the market place is that both buyer and seller lock a certain amount of Bay in a joint account. If the deal goes well, the parties release the locked Bay. If it goes belly up, both parties loose their locked bay, because one or both will refuse to release the deposit. Once the time runs out, the funds are destroyed and nobody wins. This gives a strong incentive to fulfill your end of the bargain just like when you use an escrow (but without the cost of escrow). We are at the very beginning with smart contracts, and believe we will see them used in a lot of new ways, like work contracts and the internet of things. How can the freezing/hedging system peg Bay to US$, and how is it possible? Bay is made to be used by ordinary consumers. They want a currency with a predictable value and without volatility. For example, by deflating the currency, we can make supply match the demand on exchanges. This means we can keep the price equal to a peg price (for example $1). Pegging can be done by controlling supply. By freezing a percentage of the Bay in everyone\u0092s wallet we reduce supply to a level where it meets demand at the price we want. If coins get frozen then can I still sell them? In order to allow for a healthy and liquid market, we are considering allowing the sale of reserve coins. However, the condition is, you must lock the coins for 3-6 months and the new buyer will only receive them as reserve. This can allow for new people to enter the market with a long term investment. It may also be useful for large purchases without effecting the price, deposits without using liquid coins or even peer to peer good faith sales or exchange. There are many advantages to frozen assets like lending against them, giving discounts and large swaps. David Zimbeck originally started coding almost 4 years ago in BitHalo and was hired to work on the BitBay project. BitHalo was the   smart contracting software in the world. David worked tirelessly when he first had the idea for double deposit. He worked long days and nights in a trailer in North Dakota  . This was at least a year before Ethereum had launched and was somewhat over-looked by the press despite being the only software that does smart contracts in Bitcoin. In addition, BitHalo was the worlds first multisignature wallet, the first wallet to be dual coin, the first wallet to have automated joint accounts and BitBay was the worlds first wallet to have decentralized markets respectively. His accomplishments do not stop there though. He is one of the world's top   breaking multiple world records. He is a chess master as well and top notch opening analyst for gambits known for his gung-ho and recklessly aggressive style. David also has worked as a professional actor in   as a core pirate booking one of the largest auditions in Los Angeles history out of more than 10,000 people. He spent a month on location in Freeport, Bahamas. Although, hurricane \"Wilma\" hit at the time forcing the core home early and David did not end up getting a line as intended although he is seen in various parts of the film. He has also done multiple national commercials for Time Warner, AOL, MTV promos and so forth and was one of the soccer players in \"SuperBad\" although uncredited. He then went on to produce commercials mostly referred through VideoOptimize and David took on some fairly high profile clients such as a Mercedes dealership. He then worked in web design, video editing, data mining, print work and photography. His photography work can be   He has also worked as a real estate agent and landsmen doing easements for oil and fiber optic lines. He has also worked as a Hughes Certified satellite installer and water transfer on the oil rigs. There is a lot of legends surrounding the beginning of this project, one for the history books. The original team was Steven Dai, Lin from BTER and unfortunately Robert Duskes and Ryan Wright. The four founders brought David on with the intention to abuse his name and after the project funded they left with the majority of the funds and tried to drag David's name in the mud. Bitcointalk moderators were unhelpful and the news   David exposed the project he himself was involved in after only a few weeks which took quite a bit of courage. Steven Dai blatantly tried to harm investors again in Qtum but was caught red handed since one of the investors   David has proved to be a local hero! Without him, this project would have disappeared. But he worked hard for 2 years and built everything that was promised and more, coding a 50,000 line client and doing what large teams are usually unable to accomplish in such a short span of time. With the aid of the core slack group and some of the investors, the project has completely blossomed. There is at least 10 guys who work non-stop marketing BitBay, organizing information, organizing bounties, conducting treasure hunts and promos, working with new users, finding bugs, testing the software, writing articles, proof-reading content, running a faucet, using the decentralized markets, making training videos, making commercials and promotional images, helping David be a better leader, and energizing the entire community. There is also a few guys who have stress tested the markets and are now working on various things at once. In order to make sure nobody feels left out, the members of the slack group are discussing who wants to be listed for their contributions as there has been a true collaborative community effort. So the team is in fact quite large and we encourage you to join our slack and keep watch of this post as it may be updated again to reflect this."

A user by the name of \u0093diabanhxeo\u0094 has been spreading hacked cryptocurrency clients for various coins, containing a backdoor in order to steal wallet.dat files. OPAL.png The report was brought to our attention by the Opalcoin team, as they had noticed there was a hacked/misbehaving client on the network. It turns out one of the Bitcointalk forum users has been spreading an infected client; not just for OPAL, but also for different altcoins which have seen wallet updates as of late. These hacked clients contain a backdoor, giving that user access to any computer where these malicious clients are installed. As a result, he/she will then breach your computer and attempt to steal any of your wallet.dat files. The wallet.dat file contains your coin balance and transaction history, so your coins could be gone before you know it. Fake downloads are rather easy to spot though, as the download links are usually embedded in a reply, and not posted by the official coin developers or team members. It also appears this user targeting Windows users specifically, and uses RAR files to package the malicious client, whereas coin developers usually use ZIP files.\" Edited for brevity..."

I'm now coding markets myself and may be streamlining the process directly to the decentralized model. And will be coding that. A major update is coming soon on BlackHalo and BitHalo. So that will mean an update for BitBay too. This you can expect within a couple weeks. The drama, the fact that nobody ever tried that hard to get me a staff (why would they when they were trying to screw everyone) has set me back a bit. So, for now, i just code markets on my own. Its not a hard job. Pegging is more tricky because its a protocol change, its new mining rules and Bitcoin is a bit hard to follow business logic mixed with other logic. Regardless we will get er done be patient. What can the community do? Find me a coder who is not busy doing 100 things who knows assembly, c++, python, and has at least 10+ years experience who is not going to gouge us hard on the price. And he has to be fast worker too, no hour padding, no procrastination. I might want him on a BitHalo contract too just in case he procrastinates or lies about his credentials. In other words right now, i benefit more from a super coder than from a group i have to teach. I'm in negotiations with a couple groups in china or india but im not yet convinced its the best use of funds. As for marketing, we dont have the product ready to market. It may be a premature use of funds. But Trello is a good place to organize. I can pay bounties for things that are sensible. I would love a project manager to step up and organize and handle all of that to make sure things get done."

My understanding is that pegging and the marketplace together will ensure that there is continuous demand and supply for the coin .  Pegging it to a constant value (lets assume $1 for example) would make the total value only (1 Bill + 1% per year) USD .  My suggestion would be to continually raise the peg\u00a0 once or twice a year thus increasing the total market cap and buying and selling of goods and services would increase too (in terms of total value exchanged)"

It would even be better for me, since i own more then 6% of the whole coin supply, so make me rich and peg the thing. But i am not intrested in the money, not at this moment. We must first draw intrest to the coin and make people trade with it, when we up to attention this will also up the value of the coin since it definitly will up the demand for the coin meaning higher prices. I am a investor but also my love for trading is really deep i want also be a part of an initiative that can change the way we life and trade, i have been trading since my 14th. I hope Bitbay will be an good adition and a very good alternative for eBay, don't forget marketcap eBay is set at 71Billion!! let say Bitbay does 10% of that meaning marketcap 7.1Billion meaning 1coin close to $7, but this is all wishfull thinking. I am not intrested in the price if the price will remain this low i will up my coin to 10% of total coin supply, i believe David has also 10% so we have atleast 16% wich are in good hands. I am also willing to put something up for marketing but that will be discussed when there is a product otherwise there is nothing to market for. So to summerize it all focus should be the product Decentralized Marketplace, pegging is good idea but not so good idea if the coin is not known enough. I hope David shares the same vision, regardless what he does i will support the path he chooses, but off course i am free to speak out my mind. I also wish everyone happy holidays enjoy your time with family and friends, don't forget we have a winner in our hands."

Some people arent a fan of hedging. Personally, im a fan because I think volume and use of a coin is more important that specualtion and trade value. Its like, when you have millions of users, then remove hedging. Although having a master key does give me the added resbonsibility. So maybe I should start it out by freezing 95% of the supply (leaving 5% liquid) and allow voting for inflation or deflation from there 1% increase or decrease per week. I'm just wondering if our distribution is good enough that voting would be fair. Maybe I could add parking to make it slightly more deflationary."

In orde to make hedging a succes there needs to be more coin circullation, in other words people must start using the coin. How can we make people to see the coin is by using it, the marketplace is the place to be to use your coins (not the exchanges). But i can see the value of the coin as an issue in marketplace, therefor pegging it won't be a bad idea. Because how else are we going to define the value of the coin on Marketplace, there needs to be a certain value.. My question to you is how can you freeze 95% of the coins?, i have 7% will you take my 7% coin as hostage? how must i see this you freezing out 95%?"

I already know how to use ebay, they take my credit card, and I don't care who knows that I buy old radio tubes or comic books. With cryptocurrency, I have to manage my coins, I need a wallet on my system because I don't trust any online wallet, I have to have 3 copies of my wallet or keys or whatever on different devices every time I make any kind of transaction otherwise I might lose it. I don't feel comfortable keeping $100K on my computer anyway.  Even if every business in the world took bitcoin or XXXcoin I still have to purchase bitcoin with my credit card to use bitcoin, rather than just making the purchase directly with my card. The only allure of the decentralized marketplace seems to be that it would be \"impossible to stop\" unlike the Dark Net on Tor which can be broken when the central system for a market is discovered. It seems like if I don't intend to make illegal purchases or I want to \"stick it to the man\" there really isn't a mass market allure to digital currency. What am I missing here? Thanks, DeezCoinz"

        "Hey guys, I wanted to hop in here and thank you for your support. I'm honored that you guys take an interest in smart contracts tech and are able to stand your ground with me. With that said I had a question. Its a controversial idea but I'm actually liking it. So here is the question. My original flow chart for markets I was going to get people into a whitelist by channeling their traffic through my server so we could grant access to decentralized markets based on good behavior. But this model means that it still relies on a centralized server. It means babysitting it and doesnt actually show to be a scalable model for other businesses. In fact, the only advantage I could see was speed. So, I'm wondering why add that layer first. Best to go straight to the decentralized layer, hit my milestone faster and find another method of moderating drugs/contraband that is more powerful. Trust building and ratings can still be added of course. You see guys, I learned from this project that I clearly have people who dont want me to succeed(this also means I'm doing something right). The entire project was created by some agenda/etc to sabotage destructive tech IMHO. All things considered, this means a decentralized market (if done incorrectly) gives them more ammunition to attack if there isnt a great moderation layer. I've got to protect my ass and also deliver a wonderful product. But the server layer seems like I'm heading east when I want to go west. SO, my controversial idea was, to simply require that users put their IP address inside the order that goes to market. it can be encrypted so only Halo can see it. But what it does is gives me a log of all the IPs to deter people from posting illegal contraband. This isnt any different from how a website would work. When you log into a site, send an email, do anything on the internet your IP is revealed. So my question is, if it really is going to be legal things we are selling... why hide it? The biggest advantage of decentralized markets is there is no central server, its decentralized. So anyone in the world gets \"free hosting\" in a way. If the world ended the markets would still work. Additionally, I can make it so my server can in real time flag illegal orders in addition to being able to flag them in a decentralized way. I can still build whitelists on top of that later to increase speed but im not sure its required to demo the markets. Also, having a decentralized kill switch and a system where users can flag orders is still highly attractive to me. This was my recent thoughts. I really want to open up markets to the real world and give them a reason to think crypto isnt just a bunch of scams and criminals. (ironic considering how things started off on a bad foot but its nothing we cant bounce back from the brand is strong and if we get our two major features we can certainly be a contender) Please let me know your thoughts on these ideas. I'm starting the coding now for a big Halo release(with pay to email) and these markets and felt some positive feedback and constructive criticism/brainstorming was in order."

        "Yeah but at least it is a start. Anyways, I'm thinking to combine it with a kill switch and have a server database and a way to send messages from moderator account and flagging(perhaps users can flag if there is not moderator and we can set a hard limit on the number of flags). So on \"bans\" for example we can use several methods for identification. First, the accounts are multisig. I can use one of the public keys. Furthermore use the bitmessage address. So if they spoof, they would have to constantly change their bitmessage address and wallet and spoof a new ip over and over again. And they would have to actually have some funds to go to market.  Since the wallet doesnt route through Tor either it would be tricky to spam this without an api. issie81, dont worry the soccer mom wont need to look up her ip. I can get that without her filling it in."

I mean, look at any of the file-sharing services out there that do not technically do anything illegal themselves but they still get raided and have to go through lengthy, expensive, court proceedings and sometimes end up going to jail for it. Even if David makes a completely decentralized, autonomous marketplace any government anywhere who wants to try and prosecute him can and likely will if it gets too big and becomes a haven for black market deals. If David was as anonymous as Satoshi, then maybe he could do it but even then I think if a government wanted to pursue it hard enough, they could even find out the identity of someone like that too.

        "I understand the point about Tor, but its tricky to route a coin daemon through Tor and you can still ban the wallet associated, the ip on Tor, the bitmessage address. So I also realize how you can imply its centralized but actually its not. Because if no mods are online then there is no control. Moderators are needed in some way. Like if we do flagging then people could make bots to flag other peoples deals. So maybe better to start this way and after a strong trust building is done give out the moderator key to more users. Regardless,\u00a0 OpenBazaar will get in serious trouble if they get big. I'm only somewhat big and people are already are trying to sabotage me. On a side note, its funny you guys mention defamation. There is that, extortion, and threats, invasion of privacy, cyberbullying, brand damage etc. There are a lot of charges i could bring. However, its a matter of time. I'm sure there is a statue of limitations so im not forced to pursue it right now. I can just code and meet my immediate short term goals without distracting myself. Like here in Cambodia, they paid millions to get Gottfrid sent to Europe so they could harm him. But he didnt actually do anything wrong. He just ran the pirate bay. So that should be an example especially considering my predecessors. Also, moderation is actually good too because if you were trying to trade DOGE for BTC on the market you wouldnt want that offer sitting right next to some drug listing. Additionally its hard to employ programmers in the market if its sitting next to a hitman lol. So really it is needed. Having the users moderate themselves is ideal but not fool proof. Its still decentralized actually. It just gives Halo a way to make sure people post what is asked for on the markets. As for filtering words I though of that. But there are words that cross over. Like people can mispell words too like k1ller or w33d or crack can also mean fixing a crack etc. That is why I have templates. The templates allow me to filter and predict what most people will be buying or selling. Of course some custom offers will exist but it wont be the majority."

There are lots of people who have nothin to hide but still want to exercise their right for privacy. That's what the core of the crypto movement is about and there's nothing wrong with that. There is no way to prevent or govern others from engaging in illegal activities but that does not mean you hold everyone accountable. I understand why you would want to try and filter illegal stuff from the market but it's impossible. Something's are legal some places and not others. Who's to say what constitutes as an illegal purchase? I just think it's going a little to far as they are not going to use words like weed for selling weed anyways. It would be a constant losing battle and suck up all your resources trying to fight it. The whole point of a decentralized market is to stop censorship of purchases no matter who the censor is. I just don't see how this approach is going to work without bogging you down."

For something that is illegal in some countries and legal in others, we can let it slide. Perhaps \"weed\" is OK as long as its legal where its being sold and sent. So I mean its not necessary for me to be babysit it. It just gives me the option to protect my ass if i have to. Also, its still decentralized because if I stop moderating it, then who will moderate it? I will give out the mod key to a few friends that I trust. I believe in free markets. Actually I am a cryptoanarchist. But that doesnt mean i shouldnt consider what just happened(I got sabotaged) and think \"Ok, lets not let that happen again\" So yeah, its decentralized. People should be excited that finally there is a decentralized exchange and barter and employment and all the things crypto is missing. If they want drugs im sure they will reverse engineer it or go to Tor/Onion network. And the answer to the question about spoofing IP addresses. Not only will a ban force them to use a new one but also will ban the BitBay account and Bitmessage account used with it. So they would have to make everything new again. There isnt really a way to prevent anything on a decentralized market but it helps. Also, later i can add a second layer of trust building and whitelists if needed."

Personally I like BC better than bay, but I chose to invest in bay because I saw a potential to go mainstream with it. The name Blackcoin makes me think of silkroad etc, and therefore disqualifies as a serious investment. I'm perfectly aware that a lot of people in crypto are there because they are worried about others seeing what they do. But you do want crypto to become mainstream don't you? There is no way that's gonna happen if anyone can do what they want without governments checking what they do. Bay presents itself as a coin that targets Joe, Jane, and my grandma. If it at any time becomes successful it will have to deal with regulatory issues, so why not prepare for it right from the start? Specially when it helps achieving the goal of keeping guns and drugs out?"

I did not ask why you do or do not like bay or bc or silkroad, do you know what decentralize means? It means the opposite to centralize. Government is centralized incase you did not know so at what point should govt have the control you mention over something decentralized? lol. You mention drugs and guns like they are bad? We would not want to step on the biggest drug dealers of all's cash cow would we? (govt). I own more than one gun (legally) at present and always will regardless of what laws they bring forth, i was born with the right to bare arms, it was known without that we go down the road we are half way down already. I want anonymity and freedom to go mainstream not any single crypto and people like you to wake up. I start programming and start a real decentralized 'anonymous' market but i do this in a extradition free country just incase Botswana, Belarus,Angola,Cambodia etc at what point does it become regulated by the mighty usa or said country? it does not because i am anonymous and the feds aint catching me bouncing around a far away country UNLESS they really want to and then they will just kill me no doubt but i would have died to give freedom. I would need to be able to cut out the real hardcore shit but i leave that with the trusted buyers and sellers to remove as they wish. End of story. Merry Christmas"

If you really think that then you better stop using bitcointalk... omg they have your IP address.... so crazy right? Oh and you should just stop using clearnet too. Because everyone has your IP address. lmao... someone clearly doesnt understand how the internet works. Oh and by the way, Tor is comprimised and so is Bitcoin. You can analyze exit nodes and by controlling enough nodes you can get everyones IP address anyways(why do people keep ignoring this obvious security flaw). Although IP addresses on Tor are only taken for busting the bigger sites. Besides if you really want freedom, be part of a mesh network! Its still free markets. It just means people will not be hiring killers. (what kind of hypocritical pussy hires a contractor anyways?! Thats no different than crying to your govt having someone else handle your problems) What it will do is open decentralized markets to a wider audience. Duh! Its not possible for me to prevent people from forking the software either. Its still decentralized market but I'm not making silk road. Anyone who thinks I should be making that clearly wants me to take the bullet for them. And if I did that, I would not be able to reach a bigger audience, and it would make it impossible for me to pursue other dreams. I'm all for freedom. Decentralized servers IS free. They can't be shut down. Thats the point. Thats the reason I started Halo in the first place (to free people using double escrow) and its probably the reason I was just a target of sabotage. If I was meant to learn any lesson from that its pretty damn obvious what that lesson was. And besides, there is so many services on Tor but what about services for larger audiences?! Also, I encrypt ingoing and outgoing messages so its already really secure the only party who knows about your business is the counterparty and thats about as anon as you can get. And how naive is it to order contraband and then supply the counterparty with your personal mailing address... lmao. Thats really \"anon\" man. And how can you have decentralized servers if there is no way to make your server show the content you want? If I'm selling BTC for DRK last thing I want to see is my listing sitting next to a post for crack/cocaine. lmao"

It was a really good realization. I realized, I can add the rules needed to peg on the client side directly in the Halo wallet! Granted, only people running the client would follow the rules, but the transaction scripts would be essentially the same as they would when they become hard coded mining rules. This saves me the trouble of building in c++. Then when I finish and prove the concept, my merge into c++ should be much more trivial. I will think of some ways people can help.

        "I'm not sure I follow, perhaps I'm a bit thick. By \"pegging\" we mean that we arbitrarily set the value of bitbay, in this case, to equal the value of some other object? As an example, let's peg bitbay to USD. Let's decide to peg bitbay at USD $0.25, a quarter. What does it mean that you can accomplish that in the wallet? The wallet is simply a container. It doesn't know anything about value. Even if it does transactions, if I buy a glove for 35 bitbay, the wallet doesn't care what value the coins have in USD or BTC or walnuts, it just sends or receives 35 bitbay coins. In order to peg a coin, you must be able to control the value that the coin trades for on the exchanges. You would need a very tight control on the money supply to do that. Can you please explain to me how you can set the price of a bitbay coin anywhere by doing something in the wallet?"

Take a look at NuBits and BitUSD all variations on similar themes. The rules will control supply to reflect demand. Lots of people wanted this to be a peg that grows and moves so perhaps we add voting to allow the users to influence market conditions and have a default if no vote is casted. Basically the rules allow deflation and inflation."

Both coins are Market Pegged. Neither is Wallet Pegged. A coin is a store of value, but the wallet doesn't know that or care. What do transaction scripts have to do with pegging the price? Why would you need to test pegging in wallets? My wallet doesn't care how much USD the incoming coins are worth. To peg bitbay you have to control the exchange price, I would think. Also, be careful thinking you can port python code into C++. It may not be as easy as you think, especially if you really have no knowledge of C++."

Lots of people said it went against everything crypto is about. On the other hand this is a totally different situation. I personally do not care if my Bay is stripped since it was simply part of Steves offer. When it was offered i thought they would buy it with real bitcoins and those bitcoins would also go to development. Obviously that isnt what happened. And I think Bob dumped most of his coins. But there really is no telling if he or anyone from his group rebought. And since its so much further down the blockchain, I don't think we can know what anyone has anymore."

        "Yeah im not using trading bots its purely control over supply and demand. And most likely a buywall. There will probably not be a sell wall because I dont believe in custodial wallets although we can discuss it after the fork. I think you are misunderstand the wallet peg. Because python is high level language, its easy to prove the concept in the wallet. The wallet can read the scripts the same way miners do. But it is not at all what i will be releasing. Think of it like a \"testnet\"... where we dont need to fork to try out new rules. Then after im sure there is no way to use checklocktimeverify to hack your way out of having assets frozen or liquid, i can make it a hard coded rule. As for the c++ implementation. I can use the same libraries for scripting in c++. Also, I use daemons to communicate (aka blackcoind bitbayd) so those RPC calls refer to libraries in the program itself. Also, I do have some c++ experience granted years ago when i was in my teens. I'm self taught Python and from everything I've learned, reading the bitcoin source isn't too hard. But yeah having a c++ guy on board would be nice. Its not needed. When I set out to do something, I do it. That is how Halo got built. I was determined and did lots of hard work. With that said I'm in discussions with a guy who thinks he can port my python to c++ as a hard coded mining rule. My guys went out and looked for devs but so many of them are wishy washy. So I'm going to code everything I have to get to our milestones and go from there.  As for the \"email tipping\" update, its because I'm doing a major BitHalo release with a new UI. So this is basically the last few features that are not markets. So email tipping, sending to multiple simultaneous addresses (useful for joint accouns and tipping), automatic signing of joint payments (really useful for hackproof wallets), first time user wizard (completely needed for everyone who is new to Halo to set up email, wallets, everything) When thats done, I can finish the markets. Bitmessage is already in the client so to get the markets coded its mostly very UI and template heavy. And i can give periodic updates. If you want, i can explain in depth how the pegging is done from a scripting perspective."

        "On a protocol level I have been deliberating over a few ways to do it. Basically, you make the first rule a mining rule that makes it so transactions before the fork are all conditionally frozen to spend X% of the input. Then the transaction is tagged much in the way a colored coin is tagged. So, you can use checklocktimeverify to freeze the funds as a requirement, although i think that is overengineering it maybe. Possible other ways are to tag it with a required script with a special meaning in OP_RETURN another way is to require a script in the transaction that would be redundant, but meaningful to miners and require it in order to color the coin. Shit, you can even burn an encoded coin as a requirement. Then, you make the miners require you pay X% back to yourself as change and freeze it in the input (if it is deflation) Or, you allow spending X% of the frozen input to any external address to be marked as liquid (inflation) Also, any coins that stake must be forced to either freeze or include a script. Then you can set a hard % from the fork. Lets say 10% of the supply becomes liquid. So 100 million liquid coins. Any input before block X can only spend 10% in this example. Then, in order to set the network variables we have two options and im leaning towards voting. You set it so, simply pay coins to a voting address which gets counted every X blocks. Its possible to give a \"master key\" by letting one vote count for more. Or just make it purely democratic. That vote determines if we are inflating or deflating. Now, in order to peg, we just need to make sure the inflating and delfating amouns match the market price. However, i do like the idea of growing the coins value. So maybe we can just vote on deflating slowly for a while so the price can rise and put a buy wall below it. Its really up to you guys. Since there is a few people with a lot of coins, ironically it can keep a lot of coins off market too which i think is actually nice in the beginning. miners would have to count votes and keep track of the rates for all the blocks. so the miners properly enfore the mandatory scripts."

They vote by paying to a voting address 5500 satoshis(the network minimum) perhaps one vote per address. It can for example be calculated based on balance of the sender like staking. Then the small 5500 satoshi votes are added up, they have the vote in the script or 3 different addresses are used. The increase and decrease in interest for example can be like .1% for every 500 blocks. Obviously this can compound really fast so even that can be too high so its +.1% or\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0-.1% or\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0even/not enough votes"

        "Have been out of the graphic design biz for some time now, but thought I'd throw a couple into the mix. Based on the idea of exchange of goods and services (or currency \"velocity\" if you like). Quick and dirty I admit. One thing to consider is that logos should be vector-based so you're not requiring sizes to be produced by the artist in every application, as well as allowing for more attractive implementation in responsive web designs (not to mention printed materials). Although I'm not the biggest fan, it seems current design trends are favoring flat designs - for now - so that's what I went with. Still highly skeptical of the prospects for this project... but hey, bounty coins are easy to hold forever!"
