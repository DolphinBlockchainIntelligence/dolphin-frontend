They are not stable-coins, they are freely traded on some bitcoin exchange. Then we have Labour Hour Tokens (LHT) - these are stable-coins. A Labour Offering Company (LOC, there are many of them) issues some quantity Q of those LHTs and sell them with the help of Chronobank Entity (CBE) on the open market. These Q LHTs mean the promise (actually, it's a contract) to provide certain amount of work expressed in Q average hourly wages. However, hourly wage steadily grows a bit, while number of labour hours to be provided by LOC stick to Q - number of LHT. So fundamentally price of 1 LH token should slowly rise by a little bit. The sum of all Qs is a huge number, so you can't just easily to shake market. Thus the attractor will be somewhere near the fundamental price. Additionally, in order to preserve LHT from volatility CBE will act as a market maker, using some liquidity reserve in order to buy and sell LHTs automatically by the price equal to fundamental average hourly wage. So the price will always be near those average wage. The price of TIME tokens is quite different thing than the price of LH tokens. Please, be sure to read the whitepaper before you start investing:  Also worth reading: FAQ:  Business Outline:  Development Plan:  Thank you guys!"

This was easier for everyone. Since not everyone can make bread, we want to have a \"token\" that people can trade for their specialty.

A couple of answers from the FAQ: Chronobank uses big and reputable labour hire/HR companies to guarantee the supply of labour hours that are issued, essentially creating an alternative to the traditional banks, which is much cheaper and more transparent. Chronobank selects labour hire/recruitment and HR companies based on their credibility, size, and financial performance, among other factors. Please refer to our company selection methodology in our business description document, available on our website. Initial list of companies who agreed to issue LH tokens: Anderson Recruitment and Training Pty Ltd Host Group/Host Labour Hire AES Labour Hire Pty Ltd Edway Labour Hire TIME tokens (available in the crowd-sale) are used to finance the development of the system. It will receive fees from LH issuance and transactions. We plan to introduce voting based on a number of TIME tokens voters hold at a later stage of the project."

Labour hour tokens is a currency that costs as much as fundamental average hour of work in designated country. As the average hourly wage in different countries is different we will issue different LHTs for each country, however all of them will be interchangeable to provide more parity as our system matures and grows in popularity. As we start in Australia, the first token to be issued is LHAU - based on Australian average hourly wage. After that we plan to launch LHUS, LHUK, and LHEU. Still even if you're in Australia you can trade any other LHTs when issued, surely there's no difference for us - it's just the matter of convenience for you. (edit: reformulated a bit)"

However, I don't understand why they use 'Price-Earnings Ratio - P/E Ratio' for comparison. It's a bit complicated for understanding. I don't also understand why they think the LHT issuance volume will heavily depend on the funds raised during the ICO. There are two important variables - 'funds raised in ICO' and 'LHT issuance volume' and I think they don't correlate that much. So I would offer not 3 but 9 scenarios based on their model (3 different 'LHT volumes' and 3 different 'funds raised'). When I research the numbers I'm able to give a more detailed analysis. The P/E Ratio is dependent on the TIME token price. I don't understand why it is $8.25 in the article. It should be about $7.5 for the ICO participants (not taking into account the first day investors with 30% bonus) if we take the BTC price of $750 (as they say in a spreadsheet)."

        "Good comments SpacemanOne.  We ended up using a PE Ratio for a couple reasons. First, so we (and readers) could get access to benchmarks and comparisons in the broader market. Second, just modeling the stream of potential payments didn't seem sufficient, because it seemed to imply that it was only worth it if the stream of payments summed up to the initial investment. We had a similar approach with ICONOMI that was helpful as a framework. CoinFund had an excellent analysis of REP tokens that valued them as an annuity, but the majority of feedback was that they should have used P/E ratios. You're right that we can't predict the TIME trade value at a future point in time. Since we can't predict the future price and since ChronoBank isn't giving out earnings now, we decided to use the price at the crowdsale and the potential earnings to capture a similar idea: how much am I willing to pay for the opportunity to get a payment in the future. The two values aren't exactly the same, and thanks to your comment, we added some language to that effect. If there's anything you'd suggest adding to further clarify, let me know. (also, you're right that the value shouldn't have been $8.25 - we lowered it to $6.82 under the assumption that the average bonus for crowdsale participants would be 10%) You made a good point earlier about whether correlating the amount raised and the amount of LHT issued was necessary. It also seemed like raising more funds would make the project more likely to succeed in securing users and issuing more LHT. We definitely discussed having 9 scenarios but that seemed like overkill. If you want to take on the task though, we could include your work."

        "Our world is just trying to find the best way to regulate bitcoin. Bitcoin is treated differently in different jurisdictions. If you mean if LH tokens be legal, then yes, they will be legal. Chronobank team will launch LHAU first, Australian laws allow to pay for work in crypto tokens. Chronobank legal team will work with each jurisdiction individually to make sure everything is fine with regulation. LH tokens are a bit different from bitcoin by their nature. LH tokens are backed with something that has a value in a real world. It means LH tokens can be regulated in a different way that bitcoin. It depends on the authorities understanding. Earlier or later authorities will understand the advantages of the crypto-friendly laws. The jurisdictions with better crypto laws will have additional economic growth."

        "Your opinion is valuable for me, thanks. PE Ratio may be convenient for comparison, in the end it's a matter of taste. However it should be also mentioned the TIME tokens price can be higher in future that can increase the investors gain in a certain sense. An investor can sell some of his TIME tokens (for a price of lowering his further yearly income in %) and receive a significant sum immediately (something like receiving future profits right now). This effect is not lost in PE ratio but it's like hidden and not so evident. I also have a comment on the Low scenario. I had a conversation with Chronobank team and asked a question about the expected LHT market cap in the first year. Their lower estimation is AUD 40 mln and the top is AUD 120 mln. The lower estimation is based on their current agreements. I've included the above numbers in my recent post about Chronobank, the link is in my signature (the lower one).  Maybe it's worth taking into account these numbers in your work. Your estimations are based on Chronobank's data too, I don't think the research will become less objective."

It took a long time to research and understand the project better but it's worth it.  In future TIME token holders will be able to vote for important Chronobank decisions. Maybe the one we are talking about will be voted too (LH issuance for Russia). The projects connected to the real economy are stimulating faster blockchain technologies adoption in the traditional economy. They can change life for better for many people. That's why I like them too."

I'm sure they will push it down before starting date, so unemployed dudes could buy into this maddening shitsale. What a scamfest lol. Though u know, at this time they're undecided whether they should push the entrance requirement down or keep it as is coz if the ICO bruns, u will be the first to complain over ur loss, so better keep it as is for the time being.

I understand that the laws have not caught up with blockchain projects but it may be that ASIC and the courts take another view. Well I guess someone had to do it.   Did you get a Barristers opinion on this? I'm interested as I work in the securities industry, and this is a an issue with traditional securities. I imagine that ASIC has not caught up with blockchain tech yet."

No any additional integration will be needed, because they trade many ERC20 tokens already. We'll keep up with updates. Thank you. Actually the project already has enough for a good start. More investments raised just means that we'll be able to build the ecosystem faster and to get better returns in the meantime. We have consulted with everyone possibly concerned (including ATO, ASIC, and APRA, and many others) together with AFSL.

        "Hi ChronoBankers, I'd like to share my PM to Chronobank_Community after they've resolved some hiccups with my ICO buy-in. This was what happened: Chronobank_Community (CC) picked up my complaint soon after it was posted. This was followed up with numerous PMs where CC promptly kept me up to date after passing my info to the tech team. CC apologised for inconvenienced caused and repeatedly reassured me that it will be sorted out. At one point, when there was no development after a while, and I was just waiting (not putting pressure on them) CC PMed me saying \u0093Hi again just letting you know we didn't forget you. It's going to get fixed, thank you for your patience.\u0094 Finally, I was informed that they had to do this manually and I received my TIME tokens plus 30% bonus (after that period had passed, as promised). Then I pointed out that when they did the allocation manually, it was based on current ETC/BTC conversion rate, which worked out to my disadvantage. CC reverted to their team and sorted that out to reflect the conversion rate at time of transaction instead. The difference involved was a small amount, and they did it nevertheless. What impressed me was the very professional way CC and the team handled this customer support - at a level I\u0092ve not experienced even from established corporations, not to mention any and all other ICOs and crypto projects. Way to go! You\u0092ve set the bar very high for others! PS. While waiting for them to settle my buy-in via ETC, I opened another account to buy in with BTC. Now I\u0092m patting my back for that decision  . This team/project is a class of its own!"

You are even free to blindly spam accusations in big bright letters just for lulz. However, could you please use some decent color - smth like dark green? My eyes are bleeding. Thank you most kindly. As for the contract, the thing went official, yes it's not carved on the blockchain - it's more of a regular contract stuff. I'm pretty sure we have decent escrow, all known in the community, to check all the details needed before they give us access to the invested cryptos.

A realistic timeframe please.\u0092\u0085\u0094 A: \u0093So, the plan is like that. We release DEX on the test-net next week after peer review. A coder from our team has to review the code again. And, we will release it on the test-net. In December we will be testing it. It won\u0092t be released on the main-net in December, that\u0092s for sure. Realistically, we will be able to release it around\u0085 the third week or the fourth week of January. It\u0092s a realistic assessment of this release. We have to test it; no one did it before, so we have to test it very carefully to understand that it really works, and is secure. We have to test it for a month I think. Holidays are to be had, so it will affect our progress. So in any case, our timeframe for this is mid-January.\u0093"

This is why doge is worth 26 satoshi because there are 100 billion of them. If doge were 8$ each it would be 67 times bitcoins market cap for example. TIME also earns LH fee and tx fees which will be much larger with such small supply."

We do not plan for shrinking the project. - If we get 20k+: this will mean that the project will get huge spin in terms of scale and development pace. So addition stability might be helpful. Hovewer, even if we do not reach this figure the Liquidity Reserve and Security Guarantee Fund along will be implemented to provide enough stability.

The way Chronobank assigns a monetary value is described in the   in details. \u00a0Briefly, \u00a01 LH is backed by a certain amount of human work.

        "The idea of timebanking has been around for the better part of 200 years. The basic concept is pretty simple: you do an hour of work, and you receive a credit for it. That credit can then be redeemed for another hour of work carried out by another professional or traded against goods. Instead of the dollar or pound being the unit of currency, an hour of labour or \u0091person hour\u0092 is used. The strengths and weaknesses of this model should be evident pretty quickly. It\u0092s a neat, simple idea: instead of money, you\u0092re trading goods and services for time. Time is a limited commodity, but it\u0092s one we all have to some degree. There\u0092s value baked into the concept of time-based money. Traditional timebanking works pretty well in certain contexts. It has been successful in small communities where there isn\u0092t a large variation in wages, for example. Often it\u0092s used for work that\u0092s hard to value in monetary terms. An hour of care for an elderly person is priceless \u0096 and yet the market values it so poorly that it\u0092s hard to find carers. It\u0092s work often carried out by family members and volunteers, if they\u0092re available. However, timebanking is clearly not suited to the realities of the 21st century global economy. No one is going to swap an hour of cleaning for an hour of legal work when the pay differential might be 20 times or more. And even if the industry is the same, average wages differ significantly from country to country, so if you\u0092re sourcing labour from around the world it wouldn\u0092t necessarily make sense to trade an hour of software development for an hour of graphic design. ChronoBank aims to build on the idea of timebanking but to update it so that it is suitable for the needs of the global economy. Until now, timebanking has been confined to limited communities and contexts, largely due to the administrative complexities involved in scaling it up. Using a blockchain-based system, though, we can create a far more flexible version \u0096 what could be considered a free market approach to timebanking. We\u0092ll be issuing LH for different countries, and will include a decentralised feedback and reputation system. That means workers will be able to command an hourly rate that reflects not only their cost of living, but also their skill, training and experience. Whilst ChronoBank represents an evolution of timebanking, then, it\u0092s a fundamental one that positions it well for launching an alternative economy \u0096 based not on fiat money but on a completely different kind of currency. In a subsequent article we\u0092ll be exploring the benefits of time-based currencies over fiat currencies."

Why should we contact you in slack when we are online here and you are promoting your coin here then you should respond here only. It is useless to contact their because their you reply according to your time and you delete or block the users if they caught you redhanded of doing some wrong. but here in this forum you get caught and dont have control on your post.

We see the labor market as the huge one with the ability to start locally and then proceed with gradual expansion to other countries. In our development plan, we have set certain milestones depending on the amount of ICO funds raised:  We did so strictly with regards to two circumstances:  1. We want this project to be big in the long run, and we want you to know of our plans. If we raise more money - we can do more right away. If we raise less - we can do less in short-term, but we don't have to desert our long-term goals. 2. Each milestone means an upgrade in the business model. LaborX milestone leads to stable-coin demand increase and faster velocity (more transactions), while Guarantee Fund milestone provides additional stability important on this large scale in order to leverage the market and to ease expansion into additional markets. These are big milestones, however, the project's growth speed depends on each satoshi of initial funding as we have a long list of what we'll have to do at each stage. All of these smaller and bigger milestones are aimed for wider and faster adoption of LHTs, so we do not expect diminishing returns on investment. Today's bonus is 10%, Bonus ends in 63 hours 17 min, and some seconds."

Familiarize yourself with the real world known team members on this project. Research their histories, and see for yourself. They are all committed to disrupting the recruitment industry, something they know very well as they have been working in the recruitment industry for years themselves prior to this project.  Note the known and trusted people providing the multiple escrows for this project. Take note of the dozens of media entities doing articles on this project, and take special note of the multiple third party site in-depth reviews. Take note of the fact that team members TIME tokens are locked up for months after distribution takes place. Also note the Venture Capitalist company who invested. They are not teenagers living in their mom's basement, they have no interest in dumping for 2% gain, and every interest in holding their TIME long-term. A very small number of TIME tokens will be on exchanges right after distribution and the weeks/months that follow. They will be very scarce. This is not your typical 10 million to 100 million total tokens project. Not even close. This is no fly-by-night scheme. This is a legitimate project that is going to disrupt the recruitment industry in Australia in the immediate future, and much more of the world to come after that. Don't believe it? That's ok too, just keep your eyes on this project and remember. Hello and thank you for your interest in Chronobank. All escrows information, and deposit addresses are provided in the 2nd post in this thread for transparency. I will copy/paste them below for your convenience:"

And it is really a big problem for a ChronoBank project to find a consumers (those, who consume labour force and pay   currently), as ChronoBank whants them to pay for LHT   (before the work is done)."

        "Hi, Krypt! Nice to see you back again. So let's start   from the very beginning: Chronobank Entity is CBE, this is basically who we are in the model. Right? Who then are the customers of this CBE? The customers of CBE and Chronobank system in general are those who issue LHT (LOCs and after LaborX standalone workers e.g. freelancers), those who provide labor demand (LOC customers and any customers at LaborX upon its launch), and those who use LH tokens as a currency (all LaborX users, traders, and any local users - like any worker of one of the company mentioned above who accepted to get his/her salary partially/fully in LH tokens as a part of corporate local currency system). Does this include e.g. Edway? This is definitely true. Anyways, you see this as a moral hazard while other reviewers see this as a better chance for a bootstrap and thus to deliver faster and more efficiently. For what I know from following your previous comments, the major risk you see in the system is that customers of LOCs will not be interested in using the system because they don't want to pay in advance (like in a month). However, the major problem in a short-term labor market (where all this happens) is that the price of LOCs' services today is much bigger than it could be while being mainly derived from short-term bank loans and interest.  If we use Chronobank model, we basically eliminate these loans, interest, and thus huge prices by using timebanking for solving liquidity problem. This approach has been extensively tested for like 200 years or so by quite a few initiatives, the most famous of them today is Ithaka hours (described specifically in our devplan:  ). We believe (and we actually consulted with our partners both LOCs and their current customers) this type of local currency based on timebanking will resolve the current market inefficiency that costs all of the counterparties too much (except banks, lol) and they will be able to set different prices. You should understand that initial participants already contract each other and know each other, so it's easier. Another issue is the gap between the time when LH tokens to be issued and the time when they are to be redeemed. We agreed with our partners that initially they will buy LHT right when tokens will be issued. However, in order for the system to grow and to become valuable for all the counterparties we will need to provide an additional demand for LHTs. This is to be resolved in three ways: make LHT a stable-coin, create corporate wage/bonus projects using LHT, use LHT as LaborX's internal currency. This will make the whole system ridiculously cheaper than using banks. If you think this is impossible, you should read more on local currencies, timebanking, and actually Bitcoin. It looks like you have got responses to all your questions in the Russian thread like 5 times already. Yet you ask the same questions all over again. I assume you aim to spread FUD just for lulz. Thank you for your precious time. It's about Labour Hour tokens. It's different than bitcoin as it is backed by obligations to provide some labour or to buy them back from you. Yep. I hope you didn't forget to apply here: Thanks!"

To further simplify it, There would be 176x more ETH in existence than TIME in existence. ETH supply is also growing. No new TIME will exist after the sale ends.

This means redemption is still a transaction.  2) Each time a company issues LH tokens it can either sell them on the open market instantly (with the help of CBE) if market wants to buy this much, or to pay wage to their workers - the workers will cash out more or less gradually, so there will be no need to sell the whole sum at once. About 1 week after investors get their TIME distributed, the bounty campaign will pay out TIME to participants.

For every tranche of LH tokens, a legal document will be published on IPFS with the hash stored in the smart contract.

Let's ask a question about founders of top 50 crypto projects:  How many of them had created big and serious projects before their blockchain debut?

        "This is great.... Sergei Sergienko, Chonobank's CEO has a blog.... Sergei is a real go-getter- He's even helped run a brothel, which is legal in Australia, btw. Here is a sample... \"Looking at my brothel experience, our society has absolutely no right to dictate anyone any moral values as chances are that some of the judges that sit in court, trying to uphold society's moral values, are themselves sitting very low when it comes to morals. There is a real chance, that we will see that judge in our brothel, dressed as a dog and taking a good 20cm in the ass himself.\" This post was very informative... In this Google translated post from his Russian blog, he describes a visit to the brothel by a Parkinson's victim.\u00a0 He begins the post with a picture of Michael J Fox, then uses a picture of a car lot dancing ballon man to illustrate a description of the guy, and then it get's even better... And here's a little bit about how Edway does business... \"The entrepreneur\u0092s enthusiasm for training can\u0092t have been helped by some adverse publicity Edway received in April, when News Ltd press ran articles critical of its open-book examinations and near-100 per cent pass rates for RSA and RCG certificates. \u0093They\u0092re common-sense courses. It\u0092s in nobody\u0092s interest to make them really difficult,\" counters Sergienko. \u0093The law says open book is okay, so that\u0092s what we do.\"   What a guy, good with the rubbers and the rubber stamps! \"Never in my life have I thought that I would be handling condoms by the box. I, like most people, am usually the first one to say that I love sex, but condoms by a box load...\" Happy investing!"

        "Love the effort, thank you. Everything you wrote there is correct, I fail to see how it connects with what we are trying to do in crypto world. If you are that good at using google translate in my russian blog, than you should have seen that the tone of the whole thing is informative and Im trying to bring the issue of women abuse in this industry to the public's attention.  And I really do thank you for bringing this issue to public's eye and bumping it up once again. The more people see it, the more people will start thinking about how to fix it.  In regard to disabled people and brothels, it is also important to bring awareness to. The poor guy that I was describing in my post, has lost everything after the diagnosis. His wife left him and so have the kids, he has nothing left, not even his health, which a lot of us take for granted... Im proud of the girls that understand the issue with disabled people and sex, and help them in their own way. They dont push disabled guys away, unlike the rest of our society, which treats them with contempt. Imagine how unloved you would feel if, God forbid, something like that ever happens to you. You should see the eyes and happiness in these people's eyes when they start feeling loved by someone, even if its paid and only for an hour or two. You are a heartless bastard if you do not realise why I even wrote about it. You are right, It is legal in Australia and there are a lot of pros and cons that come with it. In the blog, Im exploring some of those.  In regard to the training in Australia, maybe you should look into what that these particular courses are even about before you start pointing fingers and throwing proverbial \"dirt\" around.  For the future, I do wish you happy digging around for that \"dirt\" and maybe post something not from an anonymous account once in a while, so that I would at least know who im talking to."

Partnering with WAVES (which i am holding as tokens also) is not that bad, but i have the fear that this may have influence for some exchanges to list you in the future. Namely i think of POLONIEX. Due to your homepage the LH token is based on ETH, NEM and WAVES. I didn\u00b4t know any waves based token listed on POLO, so maybe my concerns are unjustified but it would be a pitty not to be listed there. Just a thing i have in mind."

This is on the verge of spam and I can imagine that the spam folder is the place where a lot of your mails, sent to subscribers who want to collect the bounties, go now. Once a week should be the maximum. Anything else is spammy behaviour, which makes you look bad and lessens the impact of what you are trying to tell us subscribers."

I think the team only look after themselves in coming to the pricing of the tokens, having the price at 0.001BTC would not hurt the project at all and the total tokens in circulation would only be 6 million is which not high at all. It is easier for a price to move from\u00a0 $1 to $10 than for $10 to $100 because most of the pricing in Altcoin market is derived by speculation"

Should bitcoin and all the exchanges officially adopt a new term for 0.01 BTC instead of centi-Bitcoin or cBTC and it was promoted as being the new whole instead of a part, I believe the price of BTC would grow at a much faster rate. It seems not a huge leap in price for a coin to jump from $10 to $16. But jumping from $1000 to $1600 is somehow considered major. Time would be easier to decentralize and spread if there were 6 million instead of 600K. Still rare compared to many coins but enough that many holders will feel they are holding more. Again, who wants half a Time when 5 Time seems so much better? You can tell me 200 of one thing is the same as 2000 of another thing and even if it is, 2000 will always feel better.

If you have not given money yet, please be very careful. Just running full paid ads on Google. A real coin do not need this, people will join them themselves. I think this will turn out to be biggest alt coin scam of 2017. Their are so many good coins that you never have to invest money, just bounty or mining is good enough to make profit. Sad to see some users following for Marketing gimmick."

According to ICOrating.com : ICORating decided to raise Chronobank\u0092s investment rating from stable to stable + thanks to the following events:  AXL Strategic Partners is part of AXL Group Holdings which specializes in areas such as a juridical and legal support (  ), assistance in investment deals for Australian and international investors, loans and investments in real estate ( ). AXL Strategic Partners was founded in 2006 and was registered on the ASIC (The Australian Securities & Investments Commission, the only Australian state financial regulator that controls all financial market participants, including companies and individuals.) To date, it is a unique case when a third-party institutional investor invests in the project during the ICO stage and choses to buy tokens instead of shares of the company. This move demonstrates the fact that the potential of Chronobank\u0092s business model was valued not only by the crypto-community, but also by traditional venture capital investors.   This demonstrates the confidence of the investment fund in the infrastructure that was created by Chronobank founders."

Delete every instance of Chronobank Auth in your Google Authericate app (when your 2FA is off - not on!). 2. Then launch the process of turning on your 2FA as you usually do:  . 3. Open your Google Authenticate app and manually add the new code generator by hitting (+) and then typewriter icon.  4. In the next menu first enter ANY name that is easy to recognize (the system doesn't care about it - the name is for you); second - add the code using the SHIFT button (to get capital letters) and spaces. If that doesn't work, I would also suggest you to get into G-Auth app settings and syncronize the time for your codes: - Click three dots in the upper left corner inside your app - Click Settings. - Click Time correction for codes. - Click Sync now. P.S. 2FA is needed for your security. You can use the system without 2FA at your own risk, but we ask you to be very careful in order to not compromise your email and wallet security. Cheers!"

Basically u were the only presenter at satoshi roundtable who was talking about the reason why its called roundtable and where all this rounding stuff is coming from.

        "Hi Chronobank, I've been very impressed by your time idea. At first sight, it's very good. However it might not be so obvious. Please, could you answer to each of the following critics and questions of this BTC-invester? (It is with pictures in  ) My name is Alexey Anthonov and I am a private investor in Blockchain projects, as well as a Blockchain tech evangelist in Russia. I\u0092m the director of BCFoundation, the first organisation in Russia to support the development of Blockchain technology. I truly adore different tech innovation startups that can change any part of business, government or society. Thanks to a massive amount of advertisement and the Russian background of this Australian project, I noticed and became interested in the Chronobank project.  First I decided to understand it, if I\u0092m buying Labour Hours tokens and intend to use them as they were designed \u0096 in exchange for someone\u0092s work \u0096 who will guarantee the quality of this work? For example, if I buy an hour of babysitting work, I can\u0092t change the quality of this work by varying the price. How do I determine if a babysitter is good or not? Who will monitor the work? Will I have any legal relationship with a Labour-offering company? I have many other questions. Alexey Antonov - Private investor in Blockchain projects, as well as a Blockchain tech evangelist in Russia. I was searching for answers in the documentation of the project and decided to share the analysis of risks that I found while doing my research of Chronobank\u0092s ICO. \u00a0Spoiler: these risks are even bigger than it may seem at first glance. To write this analysis I researched:  ,  ,  ,  . All the quotes and screenshots are taken from these documents. The concept of ChronoBank As it is impossible to understand the mechanism of Chronobank\u0092s work just by researching its official website, I think it\u0092s important to mention the concept of the project described in its documents. Chronobank declares its main mission as \u0093ChronoBank.io is an ambitious and wide-ranging blockchain project, aimed at disrupting the HR/recruitment/finance industries in a similar way to how Uber disrupted the taxi business and how Upwork represented an evolution in freelancing.\u0094 To do so they plan to issue \u0093national Labour-Hour (LH) tokens\u0094 and later develop a \u0093decentralized marketplace where people in real-world professions will be able to sell labour-hours to anyone\u0094. They also plan to cooperate with special companies offering labor to legal entities and individuals to perform different kinds of tasks. Like construction, maintenance, manufacturing, e-Commerce, freelancing and so on. The company sells humans/hours to Chronobank in exchange for fiat, and Chronobank releases its tokens into circulation in the free market. The price of tokens is ensured by \"hours of work\" that the company guarantees. The buyer of tokens can use them as currency, or may ask a specific company to perform the work and pay for it with these tokens. 1.jpg According to the Chronobank vision, the main motivation for companies is the borrowing of funds in the form of currency that the company receives immediately, while the work of their employees can be provided later (and so they can pay employees later also). Business development and motivation I immediately noticed one major risk, which is typical of many Blockchain projects that are emerging. It is necessary to separate the parts of the general problem that can be solved with the help of Blockchain technology, and those parts of the tasks that need to be addressed in the field of relationships with government and business. In this case, addressed to many countries and many large business organizations. It is important to understand that the main task of Chronobank lies in both these areas, but not in the production of tokens and the development of this technology. But the level of research of building relationships with new companies and the likelihood of their participation in the project is very low. What is the benefit of participating in this system, except the lower taxes and the substitution of state regulation for regulation by Chronobank\u0092s structure? Here is the list of requirements to the companies that will guarantee the performance of work on each token: List of requirements to the companies that will guarantee the performance of work on LH token The Chronobank team should have answered the following questions: How many resources and what price will be spent to verify the compliance with these requirements of companies offering the labor? Is this process legal and acceptable for businesses? The only company currently ready to participate in the issuance of tokens is Edway Group Ltd, a partner-investor project. Obviously, the partner company (parent company) is ready to help, but it is not enough, if such companies have no motivation other than a conditional loan with low interest. This creates a risk that Chronobank won\u0092t find a new partner in next few years, but to stabilize the price of tokens it is very important to have a large number of partner companies, distributed geographically and economically (see the price volatility below). Another problem whose solution I couldn\u0092t find - where will the extra value (that the company supplying the labor earns) come from when one company pays with tokens to another company? If tokens strictly correspond to the price of the working time (which is the main advantage declared of these tokens), when one company hires workers from another company, for example for the construction of buildings, and pays with tokens with the price of the average hourly wage. Will the Labour-offering company earn anything? This question requires further study. An important section of the business development that was left unexplained - there is no description of a mechanism for legal cooperation between Chronobank and the Labour-offering company. If the company doesn\u0092t fulfill their obligations on working hours, how would this issue be solved? The lack of legislative regulation of the Blockchain industry does not establish clear accountability mechanisms between companies and Chronobank. In the case when obligations are not fulfilled, Chronobank offers to use the reserve fund, but there are no appropriate calculations in case the company refuses to comply with the obligations. Another risk is how to scale up the project? The workers available at the launch are specific to Australia (the project\u0092s starting place). While, IMHO, in the US and Europe this market is developed significantly worse, and there are no statistics or calculations provided by Chronobank on the volume/number of Labour-offering companies around the world. Thus, it becomes difficult to rate the amount of possible growth even with a successful strategy to attract partners. It is important to distinguish between Labour-offering companies and ordinary companies that hire labor directly rather than through intermediaries. The vast majority of the planet's employees are employed and working in the same company, building a career, etc. Freelancers and \"labor for rent\" are less popular. LHT price volatility The cornerstone of the Chronobank project is a LH-tokens, which are tied to the average hourly wage in the country and are based on real supply of labor at the large companies hiring workers. \u0094Because they are backed by real labour, they are absolutely inflation-proof and have next to zero volatility \u0096 in comparison to bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. \" However, here I see a substitution of concepts - labor gets cheaper or more expensive for various reasons, for example due to changes in the value of the national currency or because of the increased volume of migrants. And if the real hour of the builder is not subject to inflation and volatility, any of its assessment, expressed in a particular currency, will inevitably be exposed to one or another. The fact is, that if paying to the employee at the moment when tokens are issued (or at the time of signing of the agreement) all the subsequent volatility falls on the shoulders of the company that had issued the token and agreed to fulfill this work. \"The price of LH tokens in fiat currencies is stable, which allows users to use them in transactions, keeping in touch with the cost in the AUD / USD / EUR / GBP.\" A small note: Unfortunately, you cannot just assign token to something and say \u0096 \u0093now it is one and the same, thus, it is stable. The price of any asset is formed by supply and demand, and the price of LH tokens will be stable only if the token always receives the appropriate amount of labor or real money. In addition to the idea of using the reserve fund from the crowdsale to finance price stabilization, which itself is a bad practice, no financial calculations - how exactly will the price be stabilized - are provided. LHT Liquidity * If no one wants to buy - buy yourself at non-market prices, if nobody wants to sell \u0096 sell yourself at non-market prices \u0091 Let me explain in detail why this is important and why it will be very difficult to stabilize such a token, even after announcing a linking of the one hour cost to the token. Price has always been regulated by the exchange (or an open market). As I said, you cannot make the price of something be stable, except by, exaggerating an eternally open order to Buy that same something for 101 and place the same eternal Sell orders for 100. This way you will always be able to keep the price of the goods in the corridor of 100 to 101. So, in order to maintain a stability of the LBH token price, initially Chronobank will use the funds from the crowdsale, the so-called Liquidity Reserve. Demand for LHT I appreciate such a realization of \"a stable LHT token\" is extremely risky for the participants of the crowdsale, as funds in the Liquidity Reserve can end very quickly. The market impact of these mechanisms is ineffective. The fact is, that even if a certain company exchanges the time of their employees for the token, it won\u0092t change the volatility of the national currency, which is used to measure wages. The only thing that changes is that this volatility remains on the shoulders of this \"labor of the borrower,\" because he then pays money to the worker but with a different price, adjusted for inflation and exchange rate. Or, if he pays in advance - the volatility problems lies on the shoulders of the employee \u0096 and he (for example) does the same work for less money. An hour of work may remain a stable currency only as long as it is owned and managed by the employee himself. Marketing isn't an economy When we take a look from the side, we can notice that the main powers of Chronobank team are thrown at marketing, which is a bad factor for company. Very often we see that Chronobank\u0092s marketing strategy mentions that they are changing the industry of HR/Recruitment/Finance, just like Uber changed the taxi. They use all promotion channels - Facebook, Instagram, thematic forums, contextual advertising, etc. However, when someone values a Blockchain-startup in the comparison with Uber, or uses phrases like \"total experience of 100 years\" instead of a detailed description of the technology and calculations \u0096 this is a negative sign for the investor. They say: \u0093ChronoBank will use major and well-established recruitment/HR/labour-hire companies that have an immaculate reputation to back the coins\u0094 But where are the research and calculations of how many Companies are required to maintain token price stability? How is the team going to enable cooperation with these companies? The description of US (and world) economic problems in the Whitepaper is very entertaining, but the proposed solutions with the help of Chronobank\u0092s product is so utopian that requires a consolidated effort \u00a0of not even large companies, but whole countries (that, obviously, won\u0092t evaluate the introduction of additional currency as profitable). Tech point \"LH tokens and the distributed Chronobank.io application will be created on the bases of Ethereum, Waves and NEM blockchains,\u0094 they say. But there is no specification of how they will ensure the integrity of the system and the price of a single token on different blockchains. The technical study is very crude. \u0093ChronoBank will issue tokens on all major blockchains, depending on market demand from users and the development of new blockchain platforms. Thus ChronoBank will never become obsolete on the grounds that all tokens were issued on a blockchain that falls from favour. The preliminary list of supported blockchains includes Ethereum/ETC, Waves, NEM and Bitcoin itself.\u0094 And again we see that there are no clear explanation of how this will be implemented under a single contract or system? It's not a secret that in order to combine Ethereum and Bitcoin, the most advanced development teams are making a great effort right now. The mechanism of how this would be implemented by the team of Chronobank is missing in its documents. But if all this framework of different blockchains will be implemented under a (manual) control of Chronobank, it imposes additional risks to investors and users of the system. Reputation mechanism The reputational mechanism as a major shift from the base price for work-hours is not developed enough. In fact, it is very complicated and gets regulated by a real market from a number of factors, with each specific employee. The proposed simplification has some serious drawbacks:  \u0093This is solved by a reputation system that will be implemented in LaborX exchange, where reputation is the prominent factor in determining how much a worker can charge.\u0094 \"The better the individual's reputation based on previous work, the higher the price they will be able to command for an hour's work. \" Obviously, the digital parameter called \"reputation\" and engagement of all employees under the average rate in the country leads to considerable abuse by the employer, as well as Chronobank\u0092s attempts to regulate wages price. It turns out that the worker himself can not set a price for the payment of his work, when it will be \"tokenized\", and will be obliged to be satisfied with the average wage rate in the country. This can be advantageous only to ineffective poor workers. This fact isn\u0092t studied enough and is unlikely to be implemented in practice. The team Unfortunately, I have no reasons to believe that the project team will cope with this task - it is incredibly big and serious, but the background of the team does not include projects with a commensurate scale, or even information about participation in such projects. The team description is made lightly, for example, Sergei Sergienko \"represented Australia at the G20 summits and understands how to combine the real and crypto-economy.\" Australia at the summits is usually represented by president or a prime minister. For example, in 2016 in China, by Malcolm Turnbull, the Australian Prime Minister. He also represented Australia in Turkey in 2015. Such careless description of the project leaders can speak about the absence of real progress in the business. Another troubling point - one of the founders of Chronobank is a co-founder of an Australian Labour Offering Company, the main partner of Chronobank from the real world. Therefore, we should not valuate Edway Group Ltd as a major partner company from the outside. It's a real founder of the project, and (probably) the main source of pre-crowdsale-financing. Expenses details It is necessary to have a detailed expenditure of funds raised when undertaking such a serious project with a huge amount of investment required. $7,880,000 is a significant sum but the disbursement process is described only as a list of targets. The plan It is also unclear why only after reaching the mark of $ 7.88 million a LabourX market is being developed. There are no system plans for the implementation of the \"revolution of wages\" as explained to investors. In fact, a plan for solving problems and spending money is the main criterion of projects quality valuation. Centralization and possibilities for abuse One of the main risks of investing in Chronobank \u0096 it is ambitious and centralized. They state that with the implementation of at least some of their plans, according to the calculations of the project team itself, Chronobank will become the global \"Fed\", with the same possibilities to influence major companies. In fact, it means the control of all the wage funds of the largest companies in the developed countries hangs in the oneplace, with the ability of freezing of the funds, ability to produce their currency, regulation of a large number of critical parameters \u0096 it is quite difficult to imagine in the real world. Well, the main red beacon to any qualified Blockchain investor is the phrase: \u0093The liquidity reserve is an offline LHT storage fund controlled by the CBE.\u0094 \u00a0This means that first the funds from the crowdsale and then the whole pieces of the wage funds of large companies (with the described model it is a large sum of money) will be \u00a0controlled not by a smart contract but a Chronobank team manually. As a result, Chronobank suggests a very strong centralization and trust of huge resources to them alone. Which is far beyond the ideas about the qualitative distribution of projects in the Blockchain. The main complexity of realization The main problem of \"decentralized job search that doesn\u0092t require the traditional financial institutions\" (which is one of the goals of the project) is that the government has protected the weak (workers) from the strong (employers) with help of different mechanisms for centuries. Because employers have more money and resources, they are smarter. The contracts, benefits, and etc. are primarily invented to protect citizens from unscrupulous employers. Transactions directly between the business and ordinary people, usually put those people in a very risky position. People don\u0092t like doing it. Usually only a small percentage of online freelancers can afford this type of employment. Consequently, a system like LabourX that has a wage payments for tokens will become popular no sooner than the regulation of the Blockchain technology will be clarified. It is unclear how different governments would react to the difficulties of charging w taxes in the case of the transition to wage payments with such a token. Legal problems of the project are ten times harder than the ones that Uber has, while most of Uber\u0092s problems are caused by disturbances such as arson of cars and riots. However, the authors of the project haven\u0092t provided any study of this question, in specific how would \"the revolution in labor relations\" affect the workers and the unions that are representing their interests, or how would regulators inevitably losing taxes respond. Unfortunately, there are no fundamental researches of the necessity to use a currency linked to the working time. All of the examples given by Chronobank in the Business Outline are from the past or from closed economic systems, such as small-town farms. There is not a single word about the globalization mentioned, and, in this sense, the linking of the working time to the currency - is a step into the past, not into the future. Crowdsale dynamics The ICO started very quickly - about $2,050,000 was collected in the first day, which is very, very solid. Typically, such a dynamic fundraising project fulfills all the goals and gains the necessary amount. Crowdsale started However, in next four days they collected only $140,000. Chronobank crowdsale started Such dynamics may mean that large investors were waiting for the project, invested, and there is no need to wait for such investments, which is very bad factor for the remaining small investors. We can\u0092t check and verify all of the numbers. In contrast to the classic venture investment the ICO investors do not conduct such thorough audits of funding sources. Consequently, there may be abuse by the organizers of the project and manipulation with the numbers provided, in order to collect more money. The dynamics of this crowdsale, as opposed to a uniform growth of funds raised, is an additional sign of risk for the average investor. Considering the growth of the Bitcoin price lately the amount of funds raised is now bigger, but the dynamics of the crowdsale remained unchanged. ICO-Marketing The main reason that I personally did not invest in the Chronobank project \u0096 I see it being \u00a0very far from realization and very utopian, even in spite of a good marketing platform, advertising on all the social networks and elsewhere. We have, unfortunately, entered into the era of ICO-marketing, that have no real project and a step-by-step working plan for implementation. This is a downside of the emerging beautiful mechanism of Blockchain based investments. Therefore, it is better to leave the decision of making such an investment to the professionals.  Thanks :-)"

Everyone is moving their investments to the big dogs because they are at a all time high. Chronobank should have perhaps waited after the ETF because anyone opening in exchanges in this month will get affected by the big 3. If ETF gets approved expect an even lower value on all alt coins who aren't the top 3. I expect wings will suffer the same fate. But both are great investments in the long run"

Bounty hunters is easy explanation that coin felt but in reality all who wanted buy they have already done it during ICO. In real life: you see old car market value 1000$ but people buy it in ICO for 10 000$ do think that you will sell that car for 10 000$ now? No you need to make some awesome tuning to sell it for 12 000$  . Why in ICO you think should be different ? \u00a0just have paid \"car mechanic\" 10 000$ for promise worth 0$ and you want 12 000$ today ?  that is why price is dropping simple as fuck. Stop blaming bounty hunters and start thinking."

        "Depends... what do you think the potential of a system that allows people to get paid instantly for their work, not have to deal with banks and cheque-cashing companies, and allows them to build a reputation for themselves and get paid more? Since Labor Hour Tokens will be released in Australia first, let's use them as an example and do a little quick math... according to google, the population of Australia is just over 23 million people. If 1 in 1000 people started using the Chronobank system (LH tokens and/or LaborX) and worked 2000 hours per year (40 hours per week * 50 weeks), there would be 23,000 users going through a total of 46,000,000 LH Tokens. At the quoted rate of $39.89 AUD per labor hour (from the business outline on chronobank.io), that is a total of $1,834,940,000 AUD in LH Tokens issued. TIME holders are entitled to a portion of those issued LH (3% in 2017, 2% in 2018, 1% thereafter) as well as a percentage of transaction fees, but let's just concentrate on the issuance fees, shall we?  With $1,834,940,000 AUD in LH tokens issued in the first year, the 3% allotted to TIME holders would would amount to $55,048,200. If that was divided evenly amongst all the 710,000 TIME that exist, then each TIME would get $77.53 AUD in LH \"dividends\". At 2%, it would be $51.69 AUD per TIME, and at 1%, it would be $25.84 AUD per TIME, per year. And that is with only 1 in 1000 Australians using the system... imagine if it were 1 in 100, or once the other LH tokens are added and the system is used in other countries.  It'll take some time for marketing and adoption of LH tokens and LaborX, but Chronobank just had a very successful ICO that raised what is hopefully enough capital to get things going, but once the system is in place and people start using it, the value of TIME may be virtually limitless. Right now, we have close to 7.5 billion people on the planet... \u00a0if 1 in 10,000 used the system, the annual \"dividend\" to TIME holders could be approximately $528 USD per TIME per year (assuming 750000 people working 2000 hours per year at $25 USD per hour) So, to answer your question, my forecast for the   of TIME is that getting a couple btc worth of TIME now while it's cheap and holding it could set you up with a significant annual income a few years down the road. I really wish I could get more TIME while the price is low and I hope that all the short term prospectors continue to dump low for another month or two."

        "The ICO started on December 15th, when BTC was $775 and first day participants got a 30% bonus. The bonus was reduced to 20% for the rest of the first week, and 10% for the second week. So for a first day participant, 130 TIME = 1 BTC = $775. At this price, 1 TIME = $5.96. For participants that entered the ICO on the last day (Feb 15), 100 TIME = 1 BTC = $1009. At this price, 1 TIME = $10.09 Note that both of the above examples only reflect the value of TIME that was paid for by investors. This does not take into account the extra 12% that was issued with no BTC received. At present, 1 TIME is approximately 0.0057 BTC, and 1 BTC is $1256... At this price, 1 TIME = \u00a0$7.15 First day investors can walk away with almost a 20% increase in an investment that is less than 3 months old, and some are going to do exactly that. Last day investors are looking at a 30% loss if they sell which really seems to annoy the short term prospectors that were expecting a post-ICO pump and are pushing for listing on more exchanges."

No need to try to explain the intricacies of crypto-currencies or for users to even know about blockchain technology though... with debit card and mobile app integration, the users really only need to know that LH Tokens represent payment for work they have done, and they can be either traded to others directly in return for labor or goods, or converted to cash quickly and easily. With LH Tokens, a user can go do a day of work, have their pay available to them when they clock out for the day, and be able to stop at the grocery tore on the way home and pay with the debit card, and then pay the plumber for fixing the leaky faucet directly with LH tokens from the app on their phone. Chronobank totally streamlines the payment process from an end user point of view and shouldn't be a hard sell as long as they don't overcomplicate it. For employers, I think the system would vastly simplify accounting and payroll procedures, make time tracking and data collection very easy and accurate, and probably save them a lot of money through increased efficiency and decreased overhead costs. I imagine the trickiest part is going to be government acceptance, especially since it will vary from place to place, but as long as they can find a way to tax it and get their little slice of the pie there will likely be a way of gaining acceptance."

This does not take into account the extra 12% that was issued with no BTC received. At present, 1 TIME is between approximately 0.006 and 0.0065 BTC, and 1 BTC is $1183... At this price, 1 TIME = \u00a0$7.10 to $7.69 First day investors can walk away with over 20% increase in an investment that is less than 3 months old, and some are going to do exactly that. Last day investors are looking at a 25-30% loss if they sell which really seems to annoy the short term prospectors that were expecting a post-ICO pump and are pushing for listing on more exchanges. Nothing is lost unless you sell at a loss, and if you do that, you have no right to whine about it."

We do not want you guys to lose your coins because of a minor mistake. This is crypto - mistakes cost more here, so sometimes spending 10 minutes to register an extra account is nothing. If you have not put your coins into Chronobank and only took part in the bounty you actually can use your old account. It means you can use the account your have if you do not have a single penny in your dashboard, 0.00000000. For security reasons, you cannot use the account you already used to buy tokens during crowdsale. We also do not withdraw to any Ethereum address that has been already used for withdrawal anywhere during the campaign. So please check twice. Cheers!"

Once those funds mentioned above [ (1) ] are finally moved to my Ethereum Wallet, my balance in the ICO Dashboard will be 0.00000000. At that moment, can I send this same account to ahmed, as it will be zeroed? And use the same Ethereum Wallet after that? Because I only have one Ethereum Wallet with ETH (gas) and would like to use the same Ethereum Wallet to store all my TIME tokens.  Thanks."

All you can possibly realistically have is the   that it'll at least retain its value, and even more   that you'll actually turn a profit. If you have expectations of your investment to be worth at least what you put into it, you should probably stick with banks and fiat and low risk investments. As to buying a share for $30 and getting one worth $15... it took all of about ten seconds to find this page   showing that fully 30% of the last 100 real world IPO's closed on their first day at a loss compared to the initial offer price, so yes, people do end up with shares that are worth less than they paid for them.  In any case, the price of TIME is completely irrelevant. The price of TIME does not affect how much funding the Chronobank team gets... that number was fixed at the close of the ICO. Post-ICO, the only value TIME currently has is what people have paid for it, and with the time span of the ICO, the bonus structure, and btc price variance, the value of TIME varies from one person to another. Long term, the price of TIME is also irrelevant, unless you're looking to buy or sell. But if you're holding and collecting dividends, the only thing that matters is the proportion of the 710000 TIME in existence that you have, not what you paid for it or what you could sell it for."

You have to now think of the best strategy for yourself. Your guess work is wrong. Many investors are still holding. No whale has yet dumped. People are buying Time on exchanges. Only those who invested near the end of ico have lost hopes.  Remember even if the price dropped you should use Sell High Buy Low, to convert loss into profits."

If it is, then that would mean we would need to create another ether address for the 1 Time newsletter bounty. Would it make sense to distribute it together with the signature bounty and allow both to be distributed at the same time?  Just a quick question to the team as to how that's going to be handled. Not a big deal, obviously. Just curious."

Does not inspire confidence tbh.   found the answer to this in one of chronobank_support's previous posts, the answer is 4.5 stakes = 1.34 time for those that are curious (maybe this info should be added to the OP?). Also, I have been receiving the newsletter at the email I signed up for the ICO with but am not sure if I remember to register for the newsletter bounty by submitting the application. Is there someway to check if I had signed up for the newsletter bounty? Thanks in advance. Edit: I also just noticed I used the same eth address that I used for the ICO for my signature bounty, I don't understand why this isn't okay or why this wasn't explicity warned against in the message with directions I received from Ahmed about collecting the sig bounty, but is there anyway for me to correct this now? And what is the reason for why we can't use the same address in the first place? The same address used in the ICO is being used for the newsletter bounty, no?"

Do not let worker don't know their status until job is finished or time is over, and then worker got nothing because of they dont know about their status (banned/rejected or not).  If i know my status got rejected since campaign still active, i won't continue forum post and won't continue waste my TIME. And CB Labour should choose recruiter,or Worker manager or QC analyst with good attitude, dont choose ppl like ahmed to become key in a project. If this case continue in labour hour, it will be worst platform than fiverr. In this case platform provider must protect worker and employer.

I am not from WAVES, not a member of their Team or Company. this is a simple recap of all activities and news for the past week.  i am doing this out of contribution for WavesPlatform and to all ICO tokens using it. As well as for the communities involved. \u00a0 Reason? Ever since the WAVES WEEKLY came to an end temporarily, i had thought it would be something good to have while waiting for it to come back.  In addition, i feel that those that are on WavesPlatform shouldn't be left out of this.  i would like to see WavesPlatform and all those who are part of it rise up together in full force. Not one without the others.  No payment is required. Also, all images used below are CC0 (Creative Commons) a.k.a. free for public use.  Mostly from Pixabay.com and Dreamstime.com. And a few of my own. So rest assured  I only asked that you allow me to leave a logo of WAVES in the image you see below and a link to WavesPlatform website and to its recap as well.  As you can see, you will not find any other cryptocurrencies here except yours and WAVES.  This is done so as to respect your space and the community's attention. for the other cryptocurrencies as well. if you feel the recap is good enough, you are free to share & tweet the 'Recap\" image below. Remember to add the link above this message to the tweet.  whoever clicks on it will be directed to this recap. the link is just above this message, just above where the date is. that link.  a small request, add 3 hashtags to your tweets \"#wavesplatform #ico #crowdfund\" if you can. Thank you.  For the community, please liked it or retweet it as well.  If you want to ensure that all news and activities are to be included into this recap, be sure to tweet it or blog it.  If, however, there are no news for the entire week, i will not post any recap. So be sure to have at least one.  news and activities are only inclusive of new information. old, duplicated or repeated ones will be excluded from the recap.  However, do not trouble yourself about re-posting an old news. I will be able to find out if its new or not. So leave the work to me. =) If you only a few news now, it's alright. this recap is not meant to put to shame.  But in the future, you can rest assured that i will be covering those many news. If it takes months to build a house, then it will take months. If it takes hours to bake a cake, then so shall it be. Hope everyone understands this. Thank you and enjoy the recap."

That is why all the submitted articles were displayed in the form. Another group of articles was a simple rephrasing or retelling (sometimes incorrect) of the Chronobank.io first page. Most of them lacked uniqueness, originality and quality. The third group of articles was created by authors who tried to cheat the automated services like plagiarisma.net. They uses synonyms, removed spaces and paragraphs, inserted unknown words, etc. As a result they got absolutely unreadable and senseless texts. We are strongly convinced the rewards should be adequate to the efforts. We are not responsible for the actions of the bounty program participants who, unfortunately, submitted mostly duplicated and low quality materials. When taking decision on the rewards we took into account: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  - uniqueness\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  - originality\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  - language quality\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  - content quality\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  - author's own opinion existence\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  - author's analytic abilities - blog post size Most of the negative comments come from the authors of rejected blogs.

Being a earlier supporter of ChronoBank and making part of the ICO and also some Bounty campaigns (with high requirements and scammy payments), i can simply say that they  . - for the Blog Bounty was stated, that would be a maximum amount of 3000 Times: they distributed less than 100 Times for the all blog bounty - signature campaign, well there is no need to say anything else... they just f. that up  - Investors and supporters, that had to change ICO accounts and register more than 3 different times, with different emails?!?! (is that a joke or what???) never seen nothing like that before. And is not just Ahmed!! Everybody blames the guy. Yes ok, is a poor Professional, but who hired him, for that function, has also a poor judgement and also is responsable for this poor ICO management and execution... this project will need, in future, more people to be hired, this will happen more often. You will have a lot of Ahmeds in the Chrono project... By far, the worst project (if you can named like that), that unfortunately I participate on BtcTalk"

April, 26: April, 24: April, 22: April, 18: You are not eligible to receive a signature bounty because you have not reached 50 posts lower limit. You have posted 23 messages from the date you submitted your application (12/20/2016) till the end of our ICO. I don't know much about the Swarm City so I can't compare at this moment. People need stable coins because of high BTC or ETH volatility. Imagine you had 100 ETH and paid an invoice for 90 ETH yesterday. Today you wake up and see that the ETH price has changed from $14 to $50. Not a pleasant surprise, right? Another example. Your business is trading. You by some goods abroad and sell them at higher prices locally. You have sold some goods yesterday and received 1 BTC for them. Today you wake up and see the BTC price has changed from $1500 to $1200. Your business can simply fail just because of speculative price movements. You can't wait until the price is up again and you don't even know if it ever will. Everybody likes ETH or BTC while the price is rising. But nobody likes losing their money. However, the price is not always going up. LH may not necessarily be used as an intermediate token. For example, a worker can have a debit card with LH on it. He can use it anywhere debit cards are accepted. No need to exchange LH for any other currency. You can get more details here: The article is about zero contracts that exist now and are widely used. These contracts work already. This is a reality. We discuss cases where employees agree to have the irregular works."

Should i have sold @ 0.014 and rebought here for a 1.7x - 1.8x profit on my TIME? Sure. Should i have considered the double-headed head&shoulders that formed on bittrex as a strong bearish sign and sold my coins @ 0.01, waiting to get more at lower prices? Ofc. But am i mad for not taking profits, or increasing my stake when i had the occasion? Not really. Why? Because i never looked at CB as a \"fast flip for a fast profit\" coin; i might be mistaken here, just stating my point of view, but every major project that had significant gains had to wait more than 2-3 months after the ICO end. And when i got in CB i didn't expect to get rich in 60 days. People will sell and people will buy, but when i see FUD, that's when i know that someone is trying to shake cheap coins out of others hands. It's a good sign in my eyes."

I see this one as a slow and steady project unlike some of the boomers that are out there right now.\u00a0 Personally, I prefer slow and steady to insane overnight profits, because it's less uncertain when and if you should pull your investment out, which allows for a more confident market around those coins/tokens."

        "Hello everyone, I have been reading through the comments on this thread and feel I would like to add my perspective. I have been involved with cryptocurrencies since 2013, since that time, I have never been as impressed and excited with such an fantastic opportunity to be involved with a potential game changer in the world of real value.  I have been chairing a financial institution in the pacific rim for a few years working to unify micro-economies across the Asia pacific rim. As the only value that any currency has is the productive capacity of the people (their labor or productive time spent), \"Time tokens\" by design have nailed it with the only direct link to productive capacity, it is ingenious and I congratulate the Chronobank team for pushing ahead with such a ground breaking real global solution to providing honest value to the productive capacity of the living soul. People, this is a big idea, and I believe it Time Tokens will succeed, a real investment is made based upon real market fundamentals, not upon market hype or speculation.One only has to look into Faircoin to see the work and innovation behind the scenes at a grassroots level while making sure faircoin is imune from the speculative day traders market. They are getting it right and will be a shining success. That said, Time tokens offer another tool to achieve what faircoin is tying to achieve. Investment is backing a product or team financially with the hope of gain in the future for your own due diligence \u00a0to assist real innovation to reach market use. Do not worry about today's price, its the future that is important. This is a real long term investment, not a day trade. Real Profits will be in the future for those who are real investors.,,,"

I am planning to deploy a new blockchain based on ethereum and my plan is to take a snapshot of the TIME tokens at a predetermined future block and it will be the basis of the genesis block of my upcoming project. And all you will need is the private key of your TIME to claim your tokens. I have looked at several erc20 tokens and this is my best candidate so I am going for this. So basically I will launch a new blockchain and 90% of the supply will be distributed to TIME holders (with certain rules like you should have 10 to 1000 TIME to be included). And then at a later date, we will go live and the genesis will include a hash of a future ethereum block to make the launching as fair as possible. Please provide me feedback of what you think. If I will get a majority positive feedback from you, we can do this within the month. I am also open to suggestions."

Evolution will be a smart contract platform and will be the platform i will build on until my retirement. it will be my home. everything is free. no ico. i will be incentivized to improve it because i will have a substantial stake in it. now if this is good to the chronobank community, i can make it happen. i'm actually enjoying the ethereum codebase and i'm excited. why chrono? i love chrono and i plan to buy also and get some extra evo."
