		"title": "What is it?",
		"description": "The platform enables participants (investors, authors and experts) to establish efficient collaboration in order to enhance ICO investment analysis. The platform includes widgets and corresponding data providers, which can be developed by independent authors and plugged into the platform. The platform combines advantages of automatic analysis (machine learning) and expert analysis approaches. The platform is designed as a distributed application (DApp). A set of auditable smart-contracts is used to calculate reputation of experts and voting influence of investors and to distribute monthly revenue received from investors to authors and experts according to their contribution. All contracts have a transparent and community-controlled update policy."
