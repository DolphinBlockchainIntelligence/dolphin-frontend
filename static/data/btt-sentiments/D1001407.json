Moving away from the standard QT you see with a lot of crypto was the main focus on that particular update, also improving the network connection abilities \/adding dns-seeder and the built in wallet block explorer was more of a priority rather than making it the sexiest it can be.

The website was and is a combined community effort and opinions are varied of it,( Some love it some hate it ) it will be continually updated and upgraded just as the wallet has and is. ACP has just been added to another pool and the Dev MPOS pool has been tested by community members and close to a release which gives miners like yourself further options on where to mine. adding to the list. You as a miner would have noticed the diff jump around and value of ACP spike in recent times. I do think we have some exciting times ahead.

No he didn't. \u00a0 \u00a0 It was very simple - he asked you and other ACP dumpers to back him up against BARR fudders, since you had been making money from BARR. You were in C-Cex chat, chatting away and getting from runpaint, while someone was there saying that BARR was bad for ACP.\u00a0 You said nothing to correct that FUD. runpaint thought he could easily clear up the matter, defend BARR and shut up the fudder, by asking you to confirm that BARR was the reason for ACP going from 60 sats to 600. You refused to acknowledge what BARR had done for you, and you insisted that the price and volume of ACP went to the moon due to mining activity, steakcloud, and new wallets. It turned into an attack against runpaint, with your investors saying runpaint was taking false credit for ACP's sudden success, with comments such as \"I hate traders who think they make or break a coin.\" Since he was being challenged, he stopped buying ACP. \u00a0The next day the market volume for ACP was 0.00 , proving him right and you wrong. \u00a0 He asked if you guys had stopped mining and stopped doing steakcloud, since those were your explanations for the market activity. You said investors paid 10 times the price for ACP because of your new wallet, and runpaint pointed out that the wallet doesn't look good enough to justify that. \u00a0It has an animated gif of the coin logo rotating, with a big non-transparent white pixel orbiting the logo as if it was edited in MS Paint with no attention to detail. \u00a0 It was a situation where we had to defend ourselves, and that's all we did. runpaint asked you to back him up in saying that BARR had benefited ACP. \u00a0You took that as an attack on ACP, so you attacked runpaint. \u00a0He defended himself, and you took that as an attack. \u00a0That's not what it was. If they're edited, why haven't you found any differences in the chat logs? \u00a0Those screenshots show the truth. \u00a0 It's not a big deal, no one is saying you did anything wrong. \u00a0We're just saying BARR is the reason why ACP went to 600, which you now admit after all this arguing.","topicId":1001407,"user":"BARR_Official","Sentiment":0},"13164608":{"date":"December 06, 2015, 11:58:02 AM","text":"<deleted>","topicId":1001407,"user":"ACP","Sentiment":1},"13164940":{"date":"December 06, 2015, 12:53:39 PM","text":"You're doing PR every day, but today that has led to 0.00 volume. \u00a0PR isn't what pumped ACP. \u00a0BARR did that. \u00a0 PR is talk, and talk isn't what filled your pockets with . \u00a0BARR did that. You are a capitalist. \u00a0Capital is money, and ACP is money, and your entire project is about money. \u00a0That's what cryptocurrency is, and that is what you do. And you had a good experience when you got 3.5 from BARR. \u00a0The entire supply of your coin has never even been worth 3.5 , but you used BARR and capitalism to get that much profit. \u00a0 Without BARR, you couldn't have sold 1 Million ACP without dumping the price down to 0. \u00a0But you capitalized on the opportunity to trade your own coins for other coins that are actually accepted as money by other capitalists. \u00a0 You believe that 1 U.S. Dollar, or 0.002 Bitcoin, is worth more than 300 ACP. \u00a0So you rushed to dump as much ACP as you could, to get rid of the coins you created and pass them off to other people, so that you could get your hands on more valuable capital that you wanted to spend for goods and services within our capitalist system. Yes, BARR is the sole reason your coin went to 600. \u00a0 Here is the proof: \u00a0http:\/\/coinmarketcap.com\/currencies\/anarchistsprime\/ ACP's all-time high was 249 sats, for 1 day, and then it went straight back down to under 100 satoshis. ACP's all-time-high marketcap was $813, for 1 day, and then it went straight back down to under 1 . \u00a0 All ACP, every coin, everything you made, was worth less than 1 . \u00a0BARR has spent more on ACP than everything you've ever created, produced, or spent. \u00a0We raised your marketcap to over $5,000, and we lined up everything for you to easily keep it there with minimal effort. \u00a0You failed to do that. \u00a0When BARR stopped buying, your price and marketcap decreased by over 100% within 24 hours. \u00a0 And that results in you selling 0.00 volume of ACP. And they buy 0.00 worth of ACP. You \"collected volume\" only by dumping into BARR's buy orders. \u00a0You could have collected more volume by buying your own coins, but you didn't. \u00a0 The volume was created by BARR's money combined with your lack of faith in the coins you made. BARR chose ACP because we believed that most holders would rather have than ACP. \u00a0We were correct, because even ACP's own dev would rather have than ACP. But there has never been a decent amount of volume, not once since you created this coin, no matter what announcements or updates you have made. \u00a0 The only decent amount of volume came from BARR. Your actions say differently. \u00a0If you thought the coin was worth more than 600 sats, you wouldn't have desperately and aggressively dumped so many of them for 400 sats - \u00a0especially when BARR had already announced a target price of 600 sats. \u00a0 Why would you sell for 400 when you could have waited for 600? \u00a0Obviously you didn't believe us. Maybe you thought it was some kind of trick. \u00a0The price had never gone to 600, so maybe you didn't believe that ACP could really go to 600. Maybe you thought someone was going to get screwed, and you wanted to make sure your investors were the ones who got screwed while you were the one with a bag of money. So you dumped at 400 \"while the getting was good\". \u00a0Maybe you planned to buy again at 100, since you don't believe that ACP is worth more than that. \u00a0Or maybe you just wanted to cash out and never buy ACP again. \u00a0 Those are maybes, because we can't read your mind. \u00a0But we can read market data, and the numbers don't lie. \u00a0 The numbers prove that ACP is worth less than 600 satoshis , because you sold ACP for less than 600 satoshis. \u00a0 Only BARR believed that ACP could trade for 600 satoshis, and that is why only BARR gets the credit for taking it there.","topicId":1001407,"user":"BARR_Official","Sentiment":0},"13165280":{"date":"December 06, 2015, 01:47:48 PM","text":"<deleted>","topicId":1001407,"user":"ACP","Sentiment":1},"13165875":{"date":"December 06, 2015, 03:05:45 PM","text":"Would you care to back that up with any evidence?\u00a0 Do you even believe that, or are you just throwing out more things that you can later say you were \"trolling\" about?

We have provided this hub for people to use, Altcoins in general should be used and not simply speculated on and\/or used via auto payment systems which are website centralized. This leaves it to peers to connect and engage. These are peer to peer currencies and systems they work best when used as intended ! All add posts are free we do offer advertisement space on the sidebars and headers but these will be kept away until deemed logical to use. (people may seek a service in particular, we can help them connect to each other via this method, keeping the hub for the peers and not the owners commission) \u00a0 Thank you for taking the time to read, ACP AnarchistsPrime","topicId":1001407,"user":"ACP","Sentiment":2},"15291002":{"date":"June 20, 2016, 11:09:34 AM","text":"<deleted>","topicId":1001407,"user":"ACP","Sentiment":1},"15342490":{"date":"June 24, 2016, 07:23:43 AM","text":"<deleted>","topicId":1001407,"user":"ACP","Sentiment":1},"15367570":{"date":"June 26, 2016, 09:49:53 AM","text":"one of few\u00a0 coins that dev keeps working on ACP will have its day","topicId":1001407,"user":"idolacchacked","Sentiment":1},"15454553":{"date":"July 03, 2016, 02:01:31 PM","text":"Replaced with slots game","topicId":1001407,"user":"ACP","Sentiment":1},"15542448":{"date":"July 11, 2016, 02:30:22 AM","text":"<deleted>","topicId":1001407,"user":"ACP","Sentiment":1},"15575949":{"date":"July 13, 2016, 11:52:00 PM","text":"Hello all!
